140406367.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst off,  T.N.E. has always had a strong division in its organization early on. If you happen to be T.N.E. from Wesleyan today, you probalbly know very little about all the details of the organization. You are basing it on Wesleyans records alone, while I am using both sources from both Alfa chapters. I'm sorry if you don't like that reality, or if you want to believe that the T.N.E. that you know of today is the correct or only version of the society, but that is simply not historically true, and Purdue is even mentioned as ``Indiana Alpha`` within Wesleyan's own current T.N.E. website. T.N.E. has also sufferered greatly from disorganization by these two Alphas, and the T.N.E. of Purdue today that requires tapped membership has nothing to do with the T.N.E. organization of Weslyans Alpha Chapter. I even suspect that there may be a second T.N.E. chapter at Purdue that is associated with Weslyan's current outfit.  T.N.E. of Wesleyan now is acting much more like a social fraternity than a traditional secret society of Skull & Bones, and yes, Purdue's chapter was established on the 50th anniversary of Skull and Bones as an important engineering and aviation branch. It is believed that Neil Armstrong, the first person that walked on the moon, was T.N.E of tapped Purdue membership. Moreover, If you want to believe that the page as it stands in your version is correct, why than is both Purdue and Bodoin  listed as the same name, ``Alphs Alpha``, how can this be possible? It is so becuase the Wesylian branch never had accurate records of Purdue Alpha. Also, the waterdowned version of T.N.E. that you know of today is really a start up after a substantial period of inactivity. I suspect, that at best, the mainstreamed version of T.N.E. that you know of may have some secrets of the organization's original initiation rights preserved, but have lost all of the more substatial secrets of the society, secrets that unfortunately were never recorded but passed on by verbal means from generation to generation in the same mannner of Skull and Bones today. This is why the current T.N.E. claims in their website that there are no true secrets to T.N.E., but it is more accurate to say that there are no true secrets to Weslyan's T.N.E. outfit as it stands today. This is not to say that T.N.E. or even Skull & Bones have some sort of conspiracy, but there were definetly early American secrets about the culture of this nation's forefathers that were kept private, secrets that were Masonic in tradition that both S & B and Purdue's group have maintained. That bond of trust has then also been translated into trust on a governmental level. Not a conspiracy, but just a fact of human nature, pleople prefer to deal with life's most important matters with other peple that they can depend on and trust. My suggestion is to do your homework before you delete, and continue to enjoy your T.N.E. club and leave proper history to the experts. I specialize in collegiate secret societies.

Progressives do not wish to enlarge government power for the sake of enlarging government power. Progressives believe that modern society needs government intervention to ensure fair play, e.g. government regulation, and to protect the citizens, e.g. universal health care. Beck believes these are fringe views, but I do not.

Actually, the United States already was in the first stages of what historians came to call the Progressive movement. Generally speaking, progressivism was the response of various groups to problems raised by the rapid industrialization and urbanization that followed the Civil War. These problems included the spread of slums and poverty; the exploitation of labour; the breakdown of democratic government in the cities and states caused by the emergence of political organizations, or machines, allied with business interests; and a rapid movement toward financial and industrial concentration. Many Americans feared that their historic traditions of responsible democratic government and free economic opportunity for all were being destroyed by gigantic combinations of economic and political power.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENActually there was not, either in the 1890s or later, any single Progressive movement. The numerous movements for reform on the local, state, and national levels were too diverse, and sometimes too mutually antagonistic, ever to coalesce into a national crusade. But they were generally motivated by common assumptions and goals—e.g., the repudiation of individualism and laissez-faire, concern for the underprivileged and downtrodden, the control of government by the rank and file, and the enlargement of governmental power in order to bring industry and finance under a measure of popular control.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::This is very non-ambiguousNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::This is an article from Center for American Progress the biggest Progressive group in America, and in it it describes in detail the origins of the progressive movement and it's continuance today.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::``What is progressivism?NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::Progressivism at its core is grounded in the idea of progress—moving beyond the status quo to more equal and just social conditions consistent with original American democratic principles such as freedom, equality, and the common good. Progressivism as an  intellectual movement emerged between 1890 and 1920 as a response to the multitude of problems associated with the industrialization of the U.S. economy—frequent economic depressions, political corruption, rising poverty, low wages, poor working conditions, tenement living, child labor, lack of collective bargaining power, unsafe consumer products, and the misuse of natural resources.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::``As a philosophical tradition, progressivism in its most complete form developed as a “new liberalism” for a new century—updating the American liberal tradition from its Jeffersonian, small-government, republican roots best suited for the agrarian economy of the nation’s founding era to a more democratic and modern liberalism capable of checking rising corporate power. The original progressives argued that changes in the economy’s organization required a more complete understanding of human freedom, equality, and opportunity that Jefferson championed so persuasively. Progressives believed that formal legal freedom alone—the negative protections against government intrusions on personal liberty—were not enough to provide the effective freedom necessary for citizens to fulfill their human potential in an age of rising inequality, paltry wages, and labor abuses. Changed conditions demanded a changed defense of human liberty.``NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::With the rise of the contemporary progressive movement and the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, there is extensive public interest in better understanding the origins, values, and intellectual strands of progressivism. Who were the original progressive thinkers and activists? Where did their ideas come from and what motivated their beliefs and actions? What were their main goals for society and government? How did their ideas influence or diverge from alternative social doctrines? How do their ideas and beliefs relate to contemporary progressivism?NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::'''The new Progressive Tradition Series from the Center for American Progress traces the development of progressivism as a  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

The Hebrew consonant ``Tsade`` results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as ``Ṣad`` and ``Ḍad``. It is easy to see that ``chamets`` corresponds to the Arabic root ḥ-m-ḍ, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is ḥamiʕa (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic ``Ḍads`` map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both ``sour`` and ``leavened`` (cf. ``chamuts`` =sour; ``chomets`` =vinegar; ``chumtza`` =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote ``sour`` or ``acidic``. In any event, ``chamets`` is not related to ``hummus`` or ``Homs``. ``Hummus`` is ``chimtza`` in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, ``chometz`` in the Bible might be ``hummus`` rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape.   `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

With PTC such fluctuations over the posted limit will trigger an overspeed alarm with the result that crews will check their speed several mph below what is authorized.  PTC does not increase capacity except possibly on low density lines that were previously not signaled.  ACSES does not actually handle any sort of anti-colision duties.  Those are covered by the legacy fixed block cab and wayside signaling system.  On non-ACSES routes the PTC unit is attached to the wires leading to the wayside signal.  If reliable enough this can provide the same functionality as cab signals, but at a far higher price point. Just because wireless data is involves does not mean PTC is the same as moving block or CTBC.  Finally because of the reliance of wireless links, PTC systems are prone to disruption just like your cell phone or WiFi or digital TV signal.

167861227.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Background ==NEWLINE_TOKENStereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as ``fanboys.`` Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of ``teenybopper``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==History of fanboys and the term==NEWLINE_TOKENThe term ``fanboy`` is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENPopular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe earliest published uses of the word ``fanboy`` have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the ``Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide``.  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state ``Fanboys of America,`` who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's ``Fandom Confidential`` comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into ``mindless paroxysms of adoration.``  The John Byrne character responded that they were ``a couple of fanboys in bondage`` (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called ``Gay Boys in Bondage``. http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by ``Ambush Bug`` to a letter in his comic in 1985.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Media==NEWLINE_TOKEN===Comic Book===NEWLINE_TOKEN*Sergio Aragonés' FanboyNEWLINE_TOKEN*Galactic Storm       FanboyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Television===NEWLINE_TOKEN*The Simpsons'''s Comic Book Guy refers to himself as a fanboy.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Freakazoid'''s Fan BoyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Radio/  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

But I'm considering a third request if only for my own satisfaction that this sort of disrespectful, evasive and sarcastic treatment isn't now standard practice among all admins. Hopefully I can find an admin who appreciates the very simple basic expectations that the community puts upon them. If you find long posts hard to read and evidently not worth putting any great thought into, certainly not enough to actually answer any of the points at all (and if anything you only seem moved to respond because I simply noted how long it took you to review) then perhaps you should reconsider whether you've chosen the best area to spend your time volunteering here. I see from your first failed Rfa, and even from your second successful one, that I'm not the only person to wonder if your attitude towards others is fitting for the responsibility for adminship. I also appear to have erred in assuming ErrantX was a long-serving admin, he was only given the bit in February, and people were clearly concerned at his apparent interest in being an admin for being an admins sake. If you both act like this as a norm in your admin activities, then you guys should be very grateful that recall is one of the most broken aspects of Wikipedia.

The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, ``independecne`` and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under ``deliberate discrimination``. There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems.

About half of all Pentecostals, for example, do not subscribe to the biblical literalism that their church official subscribes to. Surveys show that even about 10% of Catholics subscribe to biblical literalism (see level of support for evolution), even if their faith officially does not. In fact, many Catholics are surprised to find out that the curia and Pope etc have issued repeated statements supporting evolution to various degrees for about 100 years. If a person wants to defend biblical literalism, depending on exactly how one interprets ``literalism``, it can result in an attack on evolution, which is sometimes perceived as a challenge. This is coupled with some of the apparent incredible statements of evolution; for example that we all share a lot of features with the genetic code of other living things, and that our ancesters were likely to be microbes in a primordial soup. I do not think this has to be too complicated, and does not even have to mention what denomination the person is from to any great extent, since this is more of an individual thing. It just has to be pointed out that the reason that people are attacking evolution is that they perceive it as being in conflict with a literal interpretation of the bible, and that would undermine all kinds of other beliefs they hold. `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called ``pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. NEWLINE_TOKENAnd, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians.

The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced.

Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family immigrated to the United States when he was ten. After graduating from California State University, Northridge with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands such as Poco and America. Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show Pee-wee's Playhouse. Hartman became well-known in the late 1980s when he joined the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President Bill Clinton, and stayed on the show for eight seasons. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio. On May 28, 1998, Hartman was shot and killed by his wife while he slept in their California home. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was ``the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with``.

There's not nearly enough attention given to page titles on Wikipedia, and people don't seem to understand the role a title plays in the framing of an article and how people perceive that article and its content. When it comes to move requests, most seem to degenerate into vague debates about google results, or obscure sources from google which provide that one exception that some people will cling to with tooth and nail to avoid a change they don't like. I believe strongly that we need more people who are willing to read, understand, and interpret the rules in a consistent manner and to not merely vote up or down on a page name based off raw search engine results or their own pre-conceptions of fairness and neutrality.

This tag should not be removed until this dispute is resolved.`` What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the ``dispute`` with an act of vandalism in addition to the message ``You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name]. I want to see how much you can take before you crack.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: So in fact there had been no authentic ``dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article``. The ``Omega Point (Tipler)`` article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as ``According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ...``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state ``Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?``, referring to the ``Category:Pseudoscience`` edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as ``pseudoscience``. Your phraseology of ``who the hell`` also violates WP:Civility.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it.

Moreover, there was no ``occupation`` before the Six-Day War. Yet the Arabs, led by Egypt, still called for ``throwing the Jews into the sea.`` So the question is why? why would they want to throw the Jews into the sea if there was no ``occupation.`` the reason stems from the fact that the source of the conflict has nothing to do with the so-called ``occupation`` and everythingg to do the persistent Arab refusal to recognize a so-called ``foreign implant`` or Western dhimmi presence in the ``plundered soil of Palestine.`` Therefore, this edit  is accurate and adds balance.

459244720.0,"SDATA_5 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient.

I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source).

The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury.

448675753.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more ``Critique of the Universe`` ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc ``add-ons`` that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or ``unfalsifiable`` hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHeretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), ``the SM``. Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of the indirect ``overwhelming evidence`` for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to ``flatten`` the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or ``CMB`` (ref). This proposed revision in the ``total mass`` and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ``inflaton particle`` from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's ``Inflation``. Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is but one example of a different logical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic, mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some other theoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then, with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCosmologists are always wrong, but never in doubt. - Lev Landau (ref)`  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

Otherwise, one might start to think that ``Old Testament`` translations, based upon the Greek Septaguint, are the authorities when in fact the Masoretic text of the Tanakh is considered by Jews the obvious standard.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The term 'Bible' does not at all imply a later Christian source. It is a widely used term for the books considered canonical by Christians, that is not to say that they have a Christian origin. It is also a misunderstanding that translations based on the Septuagint are authoritative for Christians. Nearly all English Bible translations are in fact based on the Masoretic text. Only in Eastern Orthodox streams of Christianity is the Septuagint the standard Bible.

Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text.

I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying ``hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article`` would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.

Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along (I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of my own hand-picked mentors () when I came back to Wikipedia after a long break.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.

As theoretical physicist Robert Grumbold puts it, “It took two decades of IT to reveal what the Cantab editors were really up to, but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. Basically if each letter of a Cantab article is plotted as a point in an n-dimensional space, then you find that the piece on the piece on Benjamin Zephaniah, written in early 1988, actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψ-space. And the City Issue of Summer 1988 is decades, if not centuries ahead of its time. The uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist self-aggrandizement in the hallowed Cantab tradition. “In fact”, says Grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a 13-dimensional machine which time-locks a 9-dimensional black hole. We can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. But where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? Was it in the paste-up room cupboard? Had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in 1985/86? Is it true that at 1.41 am on 23 May, 1988, a packet of chocolate Hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? Why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? And why did so few people go into the nearby Indian restaurant and so many come out? Who or what was the Chief Editor, who subsequently disappeared in South America? Did (he) come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? And why does supernatural sleuth Mike Dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago, years after he’d left Cambridge? What is his dark secret? Had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? This is evidently one mystery too many, even for him….

Both the steadily increasing size of the jaws and the wear and tear imposed by a long life dictate continued change of teeth. Mammalian teeth being complex, replacing teeth requires quite a bit of resources, and as anyone having children of pre-school age can attest to, it is also a lot of bother (try eating an apple without your front teeth!). Thus, for the fast-living, high energy demanding life of insectivorous mammals, tooth replacement is kept to an minimum (i.e two setts, a trait retained in their descendants).

368442689.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==MovieFan Contribs==NEWLINE_TOKENI deleted the edits by User MovieFan because most of them were inaccurate in light of the latest research. For example: Peg Entwsitle was never in ``bit parts`` or a ``handful of films.`` Extensive research for her biography, which included weeks of reviewing original RKO office memos, contracts, and payroll records concerning Entwistle, support her having a role in just one film.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoreover, the claim regarding Entwistle's Los Angeles play ``The Mad Hopes`` in the newspaper item sourced by MovieFan is completely spurious. Contrary to this source, the play, a pre-Broadway tryout, was a rousing success in San Diego and Los Angeles during its several-weeks' run. My research discovered many reviews and theatrical periodicals containg nothing but praise for the play and players. The MovieFan source contained, ``but nothing came of it,`` in regard to a context insinuating that Peg hadn't got the part. In fact, the premiere of this play at the Belasco was a Red Carpet event on the scale of a Hollywood film premiere!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe contribs by MovieFan with regard the divorce of Entwistle and Robert Keith are only partly accurate, taken from news accounts whereas the official and complete court testimony by Peg Entwistlewhich I have in my posessiondoes not entirely reflect MovieFan's edit.

Would appreciate a little room / time to work on this one - since it is not patent nonsense although it may appear so at first blush.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I will reply for Dreadstar, and he can respond  if he needs to. Let me first explain the concept of verifiability, which is a core pillar of Wikipedia. Another thing is notability, which basically means that you can create an acronym about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without citations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc.,), then articles are likely to be deleted. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additionally, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your username is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia's core policies. I'd encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed notability. Cheers! NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Thanks Ariel, better get some foot warmers for that poor doggie!    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Dogsoc, the article consisted of an acronym and six sentences describing what the acronym meant, none of which was verifiable per WP:Verifiability, and which miserably failed Wikipedia:Notability.  The only claim to verifiability was a presumed ``xerox copy`` of an ``underground magazine`` published in 1976 purportedly recently acquired and alleged to be undergoing the ``process of being translated and scanned.``  The contents of the article, although short, were quite inflammatory, making unfounded accusations against governmental ``regulatory assassins``, etc.  All in all, it added up to, quite frankly, patent nonsense with no meaningful content.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Dreadstar, Wiki has many articles devoted to acronyms (such as United Nations, United States of America). Referring to the recently acquired document, there is now a stay order of the concerned High Court on publication of this document. We can *Now* cite the judgement's link on an OFFICIAL Govt. High Court website (which ought to meet reputable source /verificability criteria). For DOGSOC notability a simple google (is this verifiable?) news search on ``Nandigram`` should do. Finally I may mention Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View Policy which is absolutely non-negotiable.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Dogsoc, you do not seem to have read the links provided to you. You say ``DOGSOC`` is on Google, but here is the Google search result for DOGSOC  with a total of  one article from 1910, not related to this article you are claiming is notable. The words you said it stands for, ``Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities``, a Google search comes up with again, nothing:  None of this has anything to do with POV, it has to do with, again, verifiability and reliable, third-party sources that establish the notability. Yes, USA, UN, and many, many other acronyms have pages here, but they are notable, mentioned in the news, media, and other reliable sources. This acronym is not.

Yes, you've provided some sources that mention the Bulldog Party, but they aren't really considered, Significant coverage which means, ``that sources address the subject directly in detail...``.  Also, WP:ORG states ``Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found,`` however, it does say that, ``The organization’s longevity, size of membership, or major achievements, or other factors specific to the organization may be considered.``  The Bulldog Party may have been around in some form since the 1950s, though, so maybe that might help  if you can prove it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe possible longevity and the ``major achievements`` and ``other factors specific to the organization`` is where you stand the best chance of defining why it's notable, because of this statement in the article, ``The Bulldog Party has inspired the formation of other student organizations on universities throughout Missouri, most notably the Bearcat Voice at Northwest Missouri State University and the Student Progressive Party at Lincoln University (Missouri).``  However, this isn't sourced at all, and quite frankly, it's questionable whether the Bearcat Party article meet the notability criteria as well.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf I submitted this article to AFD, would it definitely get deleted?  Most definitely not.  There's a good chance that it would, but it's not a given.  However, no one could make the argument that it's good enough as it is and its notability shouldn't be questioned. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy has no one else brought this up before since you first created in March 2005?  Probably because it hasn't attracted a lot of attention and overall, it's well-written.  There aren't many other articles that link to it, so unless someone stumbles across it through those links, the only other way someone will find it is via Random Pages (unlikely with over 2 million other articles) or through Recent Changes (and since there have been barely over 50 edits in 3 years, that's not likely, either  especially if the edit wasn't vandalism).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKeep in mind that none of these arguments make an article notable or worth keeping:NEWLINE_TOKEN# I like it... or It's interesting....NEWLINE_TOKEN# It took me a long time to write....NEWLINE_TOKEN# This other student political party has an article....NEWLINE_TOKEN# It looks good... or It doesn't do any harm...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm not going to submit this article to AFD, but you really need to work on getting it fixed (if possible), because it's likely that someday someone else will come across it and come to the very same conclusion that I did about it.

Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the ``real Jews``.  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRight now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.

41974296.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding ``sea level`` or ``liftoff`` thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:* Sea level liftoff thrustNEWLINE_TOKEN:* Sea level peak thrustNEWLINE_TOKEN:* Sea level average thrustNEWLINE_TOKEN:* Vacuum liftoff thrustNEWLINE_TOKEN:* Vacuum peak thrustNEWLINE_TOKEN:* Vacuum average thrustNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

Many comments have been made about procedural failures. Each of my steps in the dispute resolution process is prefaced with a request for advice and direction about how to do this properly, as I note here, because I did not know how to request, or manage, an ANI conduct review or MEDCOM mediation properly. A decision to block me was made, which I will not contest, based on comprehensive notes from two editors and accusations that I provide no evidence. I did not know how or when to do so, but I am learning quickly.

580452212.0,"SDATA_5 :  I'll layout my mindset when writing Dennis Lo.  The employer contacted me because he had previously worked with me on another project unrelated to this.  He asked if I could write up an article.  I told him I needed 3 days to decide if I would take the job to determine if an article could even be written that was met guidelines.  I determined that there was, accepted the job, and wrote it.  Now, could the article have been written by anyone without getting paid?  Yes.  In fact, red links for Dennis Lo already existed in two other articles.  I gathered as many sources as I could and wrote what they said.  Did that prohibit me from being critical?  As seen in the Tops In Blue article, I can be critical of topics I have a COI in (I have a friend who was in TiB at the time I rewrote that article).  So what does payment get the employer?  Well, he doesn't have to wait for some random disinterested party to get around to writing it.  They arn't buying my integrity, it's not for sale.  They arn't buying my bit, that's not mine in the first place.  As far as I am concerned, me getting paid gets me to write in topic areas I normally wouldn't.  That's the only 'effect' it has on me.  I'm much more interested in this project than picking up some crappy freelance job that's going to lead to me being asked to leave.  My guess is that most established editors feel the same way.  I can see where paid editing firms who hire folks who have never touched Wikipedia is a bad thing, but for those of us who have put our hearts into this project, you're making a very offensive claim that we arn't fully committed to the success of this thing.v/r -  NEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for ``of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article``. See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the ``GFDL`` which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying ``I agree to this being put in`` is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegards,   `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

67168908.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I see a bit of confusion here, and it seems to be caused by semantics.  People can argue forever over whether the transistor is ``voltage controlled`` or ``current controlled.``  And each side means something different by that.  And each side is trying to win an argument, not trying to clarify matters.  (They already know the truth.  In any religious battle, the first rule is to never question the viewpoint you're defending.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Instead, what if we ask a different question:  how do transistors work?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: In explaining the transistor effect, if we drill down through various ideas, we find a central concept:  when the base terminal injects charged particles into the base region, there is no way for the motion of those particles to influence the other charged particles being sent out by the emitter.  There is no mechanism by which the base charge-flow can directly affect the emitter's charge-flow.   Yet if we inject a tiny base current, we obtain a huge emitter current!  The hfe parameter is no illusion.  Base current obviously does control emitter current.  How?  It's because any change in Ib absolutely requires a change in Vbe... and Ie is determined by Vbe because Vbe determines the thickness of the depletion layer.   Base current can control emitter current through a multi-step process involving Vbe and the depletion layer.  Charged particles injected by the base do in fact influence the charged particles sent out by the emitter.  They just can't do it directly.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: So is a transistor controlled by current?  Yes, if by ``controlled,`` we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the base current.  Is it ``controlled`` by voltage?  Yes, if by ``controlled`` we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the value of Vbe.  And those people who choose one side or the other can fight forever about the ``right answer.``  They'll almost come to blows over the One True Path to transistor enlightenment, since their own viewpoint is obviously good and true and right, while the opposing side are all a bunch of worshippers of Darkness and Confusion whose blasphemy must be ridiculed.  After all, young students could be misled from the One True Path!

Instead, it's easier to become a devout ``Current Believer`` at the start.  But then the mental grip of that meme is shattered by encountering the competition.  So you become an outspoken ``Voltage Worshipper.``  With luck you'll eventually be immunized against both, yet accept both.

Since you wanted specific instances, in the book named Ancient India (1956) by K.A.N.Sastri, he has stated clearly while describing Rajendra Chola I that among the list of conquests (at one point he stated clearly thus:) 'next was the turn Satyasraya who was defeated and banished out of his capital'.  This can be contrasted with the statement in this Article that Satyasraya was able to control Chola aggression basing his contention on material from author Suryanath Kamath, without commenting on the accuracy of Suryanath Kamath's version, I accept your verdict that both versions should be allowed to be retained.  Dinesh is also erring badly when he writes subsequently in this article about Jayasimha also fighting hard with the Cholas (in fact Rajendra Chola ruled during the time of Satyasraya as well as Jayasimha and has claimed to defeat both) and also goes on to add that both sides lost and won but both K.A.N.Sastri and Rajendra's inscriptions at the Tanjore temple (courtesy the summary of Prof. Huntzsch, noted epigraphist appointed by the Archaelogical Survey of India, a body of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, whose finds are given in detail at inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ - a site despised unnecessarily by Dinesh Kannambadi as a POV site because its findings go against 'historical events and their conclusions' of his liking) state that he emulated his father in winning the 'seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi' and where Prof. Huntzsch has clearly arrived at the conclusion (after reading Chola inscriptions from the times of Raja Raja Chola because it was from his time onwards that there were several wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas) that winning seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi meant winning the war and levying tribute on the losing Chalukya king.  Satyasraya lost twice, once to Raja Raja Chola when the Chola army was led by his son Rajendra and once to Rajendra, who also went on to defeat Satyasraya's successor Jayasimha II and Prof. Huntzsch once again attests the expression by Rajendra Chola I in the inscription at the Tanjore temple, a World Heritage site ': ``the seven and a half lakshas of Iratta-padi, (which was) strong by nature, (through the conquest of which) immeasurable fame arose,[7] (and which he took from) Jayasimha, who, out of fear (and) full of vengeance, turned his back at Muyangi and hid himself``, as the Chola once again winning the war (this time it was over Vengi with the Chola army first routing the Chalukyas near Rajahmundry and subsequently at Masangi (called Muyangi in the Chola inscriptions in Tamil langauge), causing their king Jayasimha to banish and then levying tribute on the defeated Chalukya.'

(I say ``functionally`` because it historically preceded the other article, so it hasn't been created with that intention. However, I feel that the decision to keep a POV version in addition to an NPOV version amounts functionally to the same as creating a POV fork.) That is certainly not a reason to keep the latter.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Re. #2 & #3: I assume you're talking about WP:SIZE.

He had already lived for a century or more in Wind Waker. Furthermore I think Kaiju is debatable. The term Kaiju is Japanese for ``strange beast`` and as Ganon is indeed a strange fictional beast of Japanese origins he could be classed as a Kaiju.

Herb Miller) NEWLINE_TOKENb. 1915, d. 1987. Age: 72 (Stroke) NEWLINE_TOKENOverview NEWLINE_TOKENHerb Miller, Glenn Miller's younger brother, was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and, like Glenn, studied music in High School. Herb worked his way through college by playing the trumpet. He spent a short spell working in his brother's band, doubling as trumpeter and also as business manager. Herb then accepted an offer to play trumpet with Charlie Spivak. Herb did have a band of his own in the early 1940s. In 1943, he and his band appeared in a movie called ``Spotlight Scandals,`` starring Harry Langdon (about a year before he died), and featuring singer Bonnie Baker. William Beaudine was the director. Late in the 1950s, Herb formed his band and toured the U.S. with appearances in hotels and ballrooms, including the Aragon Ballroom in Ocean Park, CA, the Jerry Jones Ballroom, and the Rendezvous Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT. Yet, despite Herb's best efforts, the band only met with moderate success. The only album cut by the band, in America, was on Herb's own label, Millertone. While Herb's band never came even remotely close to the fame that his older brother Glenn achieved, it is still active and quite popular in England today (1999). After WWII, Herb settled in Pacific Grove, California, and made that his home base for about 25 years. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMr. John Lovejoy, a former student of Herb's and onetime member of his band, recalls: NEWLINE_TOKEN``Herb didn't form his band while his brother was alive, and not until many years after his brother's death. He was so devastated by his brother's disappearance that he got out of the commercial music business and moved to Pacific Grove, where he got a job as an elementary and junior high school music teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School District. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I first met Herb when I was in fourth grade and became a beginning trumpet student of his. Herb's son, John, ( -John Arthur Miller, who today still leads the Herb Miller Orchestra in England), was my best friend in grammar school. Herb was a very talented music teacher, gruff but fair, and the kids all loved him. He also was the leader of the Monterey Civic Band, to which most of us Herb Miller Orchestra members belonged. (NB: Mr Lovejoy has advised that circa 2002, the orchestra was re-named the ``John Miller Orchestra``.) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Herb, for some reason, decided in the late 1950s to form his own band, and his own children were a part of it. John (known as 'Jackson') played bass and sang; Mary Luann, his eldest daughter, who went by 'Luann', also sang and played piano; Richard 'Richie' Miller, his younger son, played trumpet; and Janet, or 'Jannie,' his youngest child, sang. His wife, Ann, was band manager. Some of the rest of us were his former students who were still in high school or had recently graduated; other members were area teachers. One of his trumpet players, Tony Venza (whose playing sounded like Harry James), drove a moving van for a living. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Initially, Herb was quite ambivalent about using his brother's fame to boost his own image. He actually used to claim that his band and Glenn's were not at all alike. But, in fact, they were almost identical. Herb looked and talked like Glenn ('And now, something a little old, new, borrowed and blue...'), although he was shorter in stature. He played Glenn's most famous songs, and his own arrangements sounded just like Glenn's. The only difference was that he used only two trombones instead of four, as Glenn did. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The first record Herb made was called 'First Steps Of A New Miller' on the Millertone label. It was a failure, of course, since he paid for it out of his own pocket, and distribution was limited. And, of course, even in the 1950s-'60s, his music was dated. He thought it was because of rock and roll, which he fervently believed was a communist plot. He reasoned that the communists introduced rock and roll into American culture in order to put 'legitimate' musicians out of work and thereby ruin the American economy. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Herb had a few other idiosyncrasies, too. For instance, when people found out he was Glenn's brother, they would inevitably mention Glenn's death. Herb would explode, 'Glenn's not dead! Don't ever say that again!' Later, a few years after he'd started his own band, he seemed to have accepted his brother's death. That's when he started drinking and when he started trading on his brother's name. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``After moving to England, he really went overboard on comparing himself to Glenn. He even had a poster made up with him posing exactly like the famous picture of Glenn, holding a trombone and looking over his shoulder. This was kind of strange because Herb's main instrument was the trumpet. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Herb was one of the most intense and driven people I've ever known.

72094548.0,"SDATA_5 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGiven that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.

I wish to edit the page ``Muslim conquest of Persia`` and add these sections to them as they are historical facts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Mass massacre and conversion==NEWLINE_TOKENAccording to available documents such as the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) by Ferdowsi (Persian Poet) who took on the great role on preserving the Persian language from being lost; by the order of the Arab commander “Yazid ibn al-Muhallab” in north of Persia, Gorgan, many Persians were beheaded so that their blood, mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day's meal for him. As Yazid ibn al-Muhallab had vowed and ordered his soldiers to cut off the tongue of anyone who dared to speak Persian. This is why in Arabic, Persians are called “Ajam”, meaning mute. The event of blood mill has been quoted by the generations of historians and Persian (Iranian) ``Zoroastrian`` families to this day. In recent years however, disenchanted Iranian scholars have been writing about the blood mills and this event has been reported by Iranian historians of the Islamic era. On the way to Mazandaran Province (Northern Iran), Yazid ibn al-Muhallab also ordered 12,000 Persian captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army could pass through. Upon arrival, many more were massacred in that province and heavy tax (Jizya) was imposed on the survivors who did not convert to Islam.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome historians have estimated that a total of 400,000 Persian (Iranian) civilians were massacred. After the battle of Ali, the Arab commander (Khalid ibn al-Walid) ordered all the prisoners of war be decapitated so that a creek of blood flows. When the city of “Estakhr” in the south of Iran put up a stiff resistance against the Arab invaders, 50,000 residents were slaughtered. One of the battles by the Arabs has been named, “Jelovla” (Covered), because an estimated 100,000 bodies of the slain Persian soldiers covered the desert.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is reported that 130,000 Persian women and children were enslaved and sold in the Mecca and Medina markets and large amounts of gold and silver were plundered. One respected Iranian scholar recently wrote, “Why so many had to die or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand”. The Arabs colonized, exploited, raped and despised the Persians (Iranians). They even named the Persian converts “Mawali” or “Liberated Slaves”.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Persian rebellion==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBabak Khorramdin was one of the main Iranian (Persian) iconic rebels against the Arab invasion. He alongside his wife (Banu Khorramdin) fought against the Arabs for an estimated time of 23 years and won every battle. Records show that Babak and his army of Khurramites killed over 500,000 invading Arabs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCaliph Umar, who was behind the conquest of Persia was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian who had been enslaved Pirouz Nahavandi. Piruz was also behind the murder of Ali, however knowledge of Piruz's death is unclear.  Hormuzan is said to have masterminded this plot. Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar. During his reign almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 651, until the last Sassanid emperor Yazdegerd III was assassinated near Merv ending the Sassanid dynasty and Persian (Iranian) resistance to the Muslims. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars Province (Pars), Sistan in 649, Tabaristan, Khorasan (651), and Makran (650).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease share me your thoughts.   `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

So what? Of course there are roussillonese who may consider themselves catalan without stopping feeling french... I'm just saying that there are no references of studies or scholars (apart that GREC article) to back the sentence in the lead of the article: ``Other Catalan-speaking people from the Pays Catalan in southern France, Andorrans or Valencians are sometimes included in a Catalan ethnic group``. That sentence is so freely included in wikipedia is just doesn't fit. We could also said that 3/4 of the spaniards may ``also be included in a Almoravid ethnic root``... I'm sorry, but that is just too POVish.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet me copy/paste here the first paragraphs of the ``Explanation of the neutral point of view section`` in Wikipedia:Neutral point of view:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*``The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting verifiable perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources. The policy requires that where multiple or conflicting perspectives exist within a topic each should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as ``the truth``, in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view, or some sort of intermediate view among the different views, is the correct one to the extent that other views are mentioned only pejoratively. Readers should be allowed to form their own opinions.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*``The neutral point of view is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject: it neither endorses nor discourages viewpoints. As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy on the grounds that it is ``POV``. Article content should clearly describe, represent, and characterize disputes within topics, but without endorsement of any particular point of view. Articles should provide background on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular; detailed articles might also contain evaluations of each viewpoint, but must studiously refrain from taking sides.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, this said, again, I'm not against including that some sources claim the other regions to have some degree of Catalanity, but, as the guideline states ``Articles should provide background on who believes what and why``. So, my addition that is only the GREC who includes all territories as catalan is correct and, even, necessary in order to let ``Readers [...] to form their own opinions``.

However, we have to consider not only of now, but of the future. Looking at the history of the incident, I see that it was not just an unfortunate reaction on the spur of the moment. In the first instance, it was more than one incident, involving more than one other editor, but also, and more importantly, when your actions were criticised, you persisted in your unconstructive attitude, and, even when given more than enough opportunities to cool down, you chose to continue being defiant, uncivil, and contentious. In view of your history, I do not think that it would convey the right message to show you that you can repeatedly push until you are blocked, knowing that you will either be given a very short block, or the block will be retracted or shortened as long as you say after the event that you won't do it again ``anytime soon``. It is more likely to protect the project in the long run to let you learn that such behaviour will lead to a block which will stick, as that may perhaps encourage you to stop and think before the situation reaches the point of a block. For that reason, I think that in this case escalating blocks are appropriate.   20:27`  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

She has taught courses including Experimental Stress Analysis, Engineering Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials), Strength of Materials Testing. From 1999 to 2006 Dr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. Dr. Wood is currently writing a book with Morgan Reynolds on the physical evidence explaining the events on 9/11. One of Dr. Wood’s research interests is biomimicry, or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials. Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties, such as fiber-reinforced composite materials and biological materials. Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis. Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports. Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics.

Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFormed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke upNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSinger Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.NEWLINE_TOKENRozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPart way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.NEWLINE_TOKENLike the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLate in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death.

We have more weasel in ``ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography``. We have sources given for this. The first is invalid, being a press release from ICMEC. the second, Rhona Schuz (2014). The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis.

NEWLINE_TOKENWhile the phrase depth of focus was historically used, and is sometimes still used, to mean depth of field, in modern times it is more often reserved for the image-side depth. Depth of field is a measurement of depth of acceptable sharpness in the object space, or subject space. Depth of focus, however, is a measurement of how much distance exists behind the lens wherein the film plane will remain sharply in focus. It can be viewed as the flip side of depth of field, occurring on the opposite side of the lens. Where depth of field often can be measured in macroscopic units such as meters and feet, depth of focus is typically measured in microscopic units such as fractions of a millimeter or thousandths of an inch. Since the measurement indicates the tolerance of the film's displacement within the camera, depth of focus is sometimes referred to as ``lens-to-film tolerance.```  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

88972255.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Original Research/Other ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article mentions some details about the combos, as well as character storylines.  Although these things do seem accurate, a lot of material seems to have been written by someone familiar with the game and doesn't cite the source.  Perhaps a simple sentence, like ``The arcade included the following descriptions`` would be more precise.  Meltdown's name is probably able to be cited from a Nintendo Power.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWinning the game with Eyedol does have an ending storyline that clearly parodies Blanka from Street Fighter II.  Another note is that the SNES version had a different ending (saying something about Eyedol's bracelet) whereas the arcade version mentioned the club.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome notable game play features: I think the sky stage is perhaps noteworthy, as it could lead to some very short games on the arcade (although the Tekken series was known to have even faster fights).  Also, in the arcade Eyedol had a notably easy infinite combo (when the opponent was at the edge of a stage), plus a much more difficult infinite combo (running back and forth), and the SNES version didn't have these things.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe comment above about tapping a low button might be referring to the easy repeatable combos in KI2, which would be another game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKI1 and KI2 used the exact same motherboard (the model # / name / whatever was identical on both motherboards), and the software was different only by the chips installed in the motherboard and the hard drive.  (Surprising, perhaps, considering how different the games graphical feels look from each other.)  These games used the Ultra 64 hardware, which was the correct name for the hardware at the time of KI1's release.  Rare had said (in some unofficial strategy guide) that they had no concerns/reason-to-worry about KI Gold matching the performance of KI2, making some smart remark about those concerns only being needed when moving to a less powerful machine.  (KI Gold was initially also going to have more characters, but the memory limitations of the cartridge later proved to prevent this.)  Therefore, it's not out of line to think that the N64 is really significantly different than the Ultra 64, other than the lack of the hard drive.  Cruisin' USA is known to use some other motherboard, and reference the Ultra 64 just as an unrelated advertisement.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBugs in the game could probably get their own section, including Orchid's attacking after turning into a frog, opponents shrinking with Thunder's combo, Riptor being unable to get a high hitting combo when the Ultra misses, and the fight being able to continue on after Orchid initiates her Ultra (if initiated after hitting the opponent into the air and then backflipping, and having the opponent hit her out of the Ultra).`  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, ``many`` is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (``my way is the correct one`` type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using ``many`` or ``most`` or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that ``many`` do (I wouldn't even object to ``almost all`` or ``most``), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!  `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENSince 1986, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King’s College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely’s psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely’s role in the politics of ME. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ‘edit police’ who cruise the pages seeking ‘vandalism’ and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia’s self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‘Jimbo’ Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENWhen, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality – ‘we are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute’ - the debate entered another level.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENIt seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know?

Wheeler.However, the information regarding geometrodynamics is not accurate, especially the following statement: ``Wheeler abandoned it as fruitless in the 1970s``.As a matter of fact, Wheeler kept using the term ``geometrodynamics`` to describe Einstein's theory of general relativity till his last days. For example, in Gravitation and Inertia, a book written with the Italian physicist I.Ciufolini in 1995(and which was missing from the bibliography), the authors keep referring to ``Einstein Geometrodynamics``(the title of Chapter 2) throughout the the book: Chapter 3 is entitled `` Tests ofEinstein Geometrodynamics``, Chapter 5 is ``The Initial-Value Problem in Einstein Geometrodynamics`` and Chapter 7:``Some Highlights of the past and a Summary of Geometrodynamics and Inertia``.This proves that Wheeler did not abandon the concept at all in the 1970s!NEWLINE_TOKEN  Georges E.

I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia. Here is something that I have to say as regards your recent posts in this page:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* About:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEukesh, you say all the right things, that we need a neutral article, that you want to be constructive, but at the end of it, it seems your mind is closed. You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available? you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan.

Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details.

And then, I cannot see what would be the use of these edits, because first they're all unsourced, and then, they have no use, no importance, no encyclopedical relevance, they were only made in a revenge attempt. And finally, please have the decency to stop talking about ``consensus``, because first you have always ignored them (I remind you everyone was against your fansub edits, you did them nonetheless), so reading ``consensus`` in one of your post will always make me laugh. And second, I don't think we can talk about ``consensus`` when the the only people that support you are yourself and your own sockpuppets. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, just get over it.

342502093.0,"SDATA_5 :  `I think that, at the level of basic fundamental principles, we may actually be in agreement. I would agree that it's inappropriate for Editor ``A`` to insert a format that Editor ``A``  ‘’knows’’ is non-standard,  and then request a consensus before it's overturned by Editor ``B`` as soon after the posting as is reasonably practicable,” or at least provide some explanation for using this non-standard format. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor ``A`` knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor ``A`` added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor ``A``, I think then that Editor ``B`` should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor ``A`` in a format that Editor ``B,`` acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor ``A`` was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIsn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor ``A`` has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point.

To a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing, but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing, and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, the secret source in the business.dk article referenced claims that Saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns (in order to take unfair advantage of customers).

This means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest.

(This does not mean that I support edit warring on BLPs in general, edit warring over well-sourced information remains unacceptable.)

200247546.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Dear Mr.Slrubenstein. Your point about NOR and verifiable sources is well taken. Accordingly I am providing an official Government of India biography of Ram Mohan Roy from the Press & Information Ministry of India which claims that Roy studied Judaism (in addition to other religions). The URL is http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fmay2002/f020520021.html . I do not know if you will recognise this because this same government for many years did not recognise the State (country) of Israel. Of course this only states that Roy ``studied`` Judaism and is not conclusive proof that Brahmoism was influenced by Judaism. However, we find significant similarities between the Brahmo Dharma beej of 1850 and some tenets of Judaism such as Maimonides. You will appreciate that these issues are unproveable and matters of faith and I do not doubt yours. Likewise, I leave it up to you to do the right thing. Brahmos are highly unlikely to claim that they are Jews (of any kind) or distort / vandalise your religion/faith. My Brahmo religion specifically prohibits reviling or disparaging other faiths whilst emphasising strengthening the bonds between *men* of different faiths. I personally have not known many Jews (Judaists) as there are so few in India, I was lucky to have a learned tutor - his name was Ezra - he had a PhD and attended synagogue and I learnt many things from him besides Mathematics. I respect your wishes to scrutinise all the other faiths which claim to have been influenced by Judaism. Sincerely.   `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

Instigating a firefight that is almost certain to cost the lives of many if not all the crew members of the MV Faina where one might not be necessary would be astonishingly stupid. At present the order of the day is containment while negotiations are carried out to secure a peaceful outcome. In any case if the ship were to be boarded it would be done by special operations units who would have been very unlikely to have been aboard the American vessel when the crisis arose.

By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

No. The expanded definition for the GSC and TCC still stand, and as HBK never even wrestled for WWF/WWE while the HC title was active I have no idea why his bio would ever talk about the HC title.

223213775.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== stradbroke galleon / portuguese ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENhallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by ``mainstream`` academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the ``mainstream`` view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    `  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

The persian spelling is originally from Ilkhanid times and we see diverse spelling like Airavan, Irevan, Erevan and much more. The spelling used by EI is one I adopted. I thought it would be easy just to say Yerevan, but seems people are upset. I know Encyclopedia of Islam (English and Turkish version) will have articles about this and also the book by the American scholar Bournotian as someone above mentioned. His work is considered the most important work and most authorative on the topic and is a big book opposed to several page article in iranian encyclopedia. Also, anyone who studies this state will affeliate it with nothing but Persian empire of Safavids and Qajars and anyone between,. I studied bournoutian book beofre and he spends a lot to explain about ethnic groups of persians, kurds, armenians, and Turkic tribes (dozens!) with specific names and islaimc denominations, I think Qizil Bash, Qara Qoyunli (tribe name, not to be confused with famous states and organization associated with names), these Turkic people were not referred to as Azeris, but muslim tribesmen.

If you put a lot of work in you may eventually succeed, but it'll probably take a lot longer than you'd think. One example is the Article Wizard - this took about 2 years from gestation to completing its implementation. And that doesn't really challenge anyone's power, does it? This sort of structural inertia is why I created Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab), to at least try and have a space where ideas don't get shot down so quickly. Bottom line, the difficulty of changing the governance is not unique - though it's clearly a special case of being even harder. The only solution is to keep trying to come up with new ideas. PS The problem is not so much being given the tools indefinitely; the processes for removal of tools where that's clearly warranted are not so bad. The difficulty is in handling low and mid-level problems, and a certain tendency from people who've heard Wolf cried too many times to dismiss any problems short of ``desysop now`` seriousness as either bellyaching from troublemakers or just minor stuff of the ``everyone makes mistakes`` variety.

It makes no difference whether or not those text ``logos`` are ``official``, they are not used in any capacity on the uniforms or in the venues of the teams in question, and thus cannot serve as ``equivalent`` replacements for the logo that millions of people have been exposed to over decades and have come to recognize as THE identifier of the school's teams. The text logo might be used solely on the letterhead of the various team sports for all we know, but it certainly isn't used by the teams themselves, and thus doesn't serve the encyclopedic purpose of serving as an identifier for them. It's pretty disingenuous to suggest that any encyclopedia (other than one manipulated by a few people who simply enjoy being disruptive) would ever have an article about USC football, basketball, etc. without providing the primary logo used by those teams. But I guess that's why my professors laugh when anyone asks if using Wikipedia as a reliable source is acceptable, and thanks to people like the two I've dealt with here, I guess they'll always be laughing when students ask that question.

Clearly, the policy change from using to not using a colon was therefore initiated with the release of Star Trek Generations and Wikipedia should reflect this. Another consideration is that if the title of this article ``Star Trek Into Darkness`` is going to stay this way (which, btw, I support and find sensible), there will be an inconsistency in the titling of movie articles, because one article (this one) would use the titling as in the official source, whereas the other(s) would use titling according to Wikipedian style rules.

The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.``NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGovernment schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMost comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their ``Nationalist`` and ``New Nation`` magazines, the ``Nationalist Educational Association`` and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward`` was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the ``Nationalist`` magazine, and he preached what he called ``military socialism.``  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the ``Wholecaust`` (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'   : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

Again, I ask you - instead of tagging articles, how about adding content to them? An example of a newly created article I did that with, Django Walker, was listed at DYK.

441306801.0,"SDATA_5 :  “Claim Kshatriya status, but generally recognised as Shudra” This is a claim of consensus claim. I see no source which is defining a consensus. What these sources are saying is their own view only. A source defining a consensus would be saying something like “Most people think Kurmis are S*****”. There is no such source. Besides that, the sentence in the article is immensely confusing. It does not spell out who regards Kurmis as S*****. That should be clear. Who? Indians? Certinly not. Martians? Are you serious? Americans? Most of them won’t happen to know what is “Kurmi”. Who else? Academics? Where do we have a source saying that? Showing ten sources that talk about Kurmis as S***** and concluding on our own that they are generally regarded as X won’t do. That is synthesis/OR. Then we have to guard against cherry picking too (as Nameisnotimportant has been indicating)(cherry picking is one of the major pitfalls of using GBooks). Even if we do find a non cherry picked clear statement, we will have to see if the statement is encyclopedic enough. That would mean, we need to find the same statement in another encyclopedia to say the same thing in the same way, i.e. near the top of the article. I don’t really think this can be done by these sources (or any other sources). IMO the statement is best scrapped and replaced by something like “Recognition:Recognized by GOI as OBC”. It makes no sense to say “Claim Kshatriya status, but generally recognised as Shudra” because they are not S*****. ASAT. I am glad that we now have some fresh users on the talk page and agree that their presence and their suggestions have helped let the discussion take a positive and meaningful turn. We have quotes on the page now, some degree of  willingness to discuss things in a meaningful manner. As I have been saying, if we want to keep the present sentence, we have to come up with a clear, non cherry picked, encyclopedic quote defining a consensus. We don’t have it IMO. There may be other considerations too, and I may bring them up if necessary. I would suggest that the sentence be changed.-  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

If he wants to go through and put the line ``a traditional Catholic website`` after any link to my site, then fine. But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a ``blog,`` ``POV,`` ``monograph,`` 'linkspam,`` etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair ``hearing,`` if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another ``Oh, great, he wins again!`` type situation.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe purpose is that the reader should not understand the word ``free`` to mean ``gratis`` in this case. Unfortunately just using ``free`` alone makes it more likely that people will understand ``gratis``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you software into that phrase ``free and open source`` something like ``open source and free software`` it would be better.NEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_5,test,-1,-1
68095122.0,"SDATA_5 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease re-consider once again, Im not sure if its appropiate for me to discuss this here, let me know if its not, I dont want to break any rules.NEWLINE_TOKENI investigated the following in hopes to get a better resolution, I dont feel like the external links page shouldn't include the following if my site is not allowed because they contain the exact same things as my site, also, just because I am the owner of the site and am adding it, what would be the difference if I acted like I wasnt the owner? I I have only one link to the graffiti store once you enter the site, and its nowhere on the gallery or the top navigation, but just because I have a store doesnt mean I was posting my site in order to promote it, I was certainly not, or else I would of tried to add the store url when I added the other url. Also like I said before, my site has been up since 1997 off a different domain, and since 1999 off the current domain. We are ranked 5 on google, and get plenty of hits on our own, I was not trying to add my site here to receive more hits. PureGraffiti.com is going to be online for as long as the internet is alive, the gallery will be the biggest gallery of graffiti art online, weather one agrees with me or not, you can take a look at the stats and figure it out yourself. We are online for Graffiti Artists that dont have the knowledge or money to get their pictures up on a website that is already established and well known by almost everyone in the USA that is a Graffiti Artist. The store we have merely pays for the dedicated server bill costs to keep this huge site alive, and there are 500 other stores online that do advertize on google and other sites, we on the other hand dont. We also dont charge for the webspace, and we also dont have advertizing for money on our site in hopes to make money of our viewers like many of the sites you have accepted.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease take all this into consideration:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENhttp://www.Artcimes.org = first graffiti site. They have a store as well, and they have advertizing for money all through-out their site. Just because they are the first graffiti site, doesnt give them any special treatment. NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://www.bombing.org = Advertizing for money all over the siteNEWLINE_TOKENhttp://writers.org.ua = advertizing for money pop-up when visited the site.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENP.S. By no means I have a problem with these sites, however, I do think it is unfair that they get to be on there when my site is the same, and does not contain advertizements to make money.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you once again.NEWLINE_TOKENSabrina  : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

679995088.0,"SDATA_5 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think. It'd be a big chunk of work to implement if links end up having to be added, although it's the kind of gnoming that's right up my alley, as you know. >)     : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1

I didn't start editing war.  started it by forcing Persian script to Azeris. even we accept persian script, He added a word that is not grammatically correct in Azeri with Persian script. to solve it i added west Azerbaijan translation in Azeri in both Latin and persian scripts. i don't know why he thinks we should follow his idea to use Fazeri (a fake language which uses completely Persian words with one azeri verb at the end). For instance in Azeri similar to English adjective comes first followed by a noun. But in Farsi noun comes first.  wanted to force Perisan words for west( غربی )and Azerbaijan(آذربایجان) and suggests using غربی آذربایجان. hence, we don't use as the first word in Azeri.      : EDATA_5",test,-1,-1
