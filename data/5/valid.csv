From what groups did this ``indigenous`` label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in ``Canadian`` ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.``   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_5",dev,0

Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from ``Chabenisky`` when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of ``World's Richest People``, with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the ``largest single e-commerce transaction``, after he paid $40   : EDATA_5",dev,0

All it's surviving members were treated as freedom fighters by the Indian governement after independence, however none were reinducted into the Indian Army,thus as a force the I.N.A did not evolve into the Indian Army but ceased to exist. However the force that defeated it- the British Indian Army, was in existence and the officers and men went on to form the Indian Army. So it's hard to agree that the INA was a predecessor.

A good faith suggestion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* It is relevant to denote her race in terms of the cosmetics work with Cover Girl; I strongly disagree that black models are 'not particularly seen less often than caucasian models' in this style of model work or any other, especially in an international context.  Although they may do 'as well' relatively, the amount of work is markedly less than that for caucasian models outside of the U.S.  Tesfay was born in Canada of Eritrean descent so the common descriptor ``African American`` is erroneous.

For an article needing to find more sources, recent removals of all weblinks seems a bit overzealous to me.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==CALENDARS==NEWLINE_TOKENThe whole calendar paragraph is problematic now, I think; too big for the article relative to its significance. It's not possible to rank these along with ANTM, print magazines, etc., any more than online magazines, because they don't have anything like the same kind of public reach, and the naming of specific calendars in the first place invites spam. Since 2007, the year of the named calendars, is (nearly) over, and they haven't become annual publications, I think the paragraph should be cut back to refer to the launch of several calendars in general, without naming specifics, otherwise there's the impossible requirement of defining exactly what is or is not a notable calendar.  Also, the sentence about fostering a healthier industry attitude is too generic and applies to many projects involving plus-size models, not just these calendars. You'd need to repeat the same sentence in nearly every item in the article if it appears here. I recommend something like, ``2007 was the launch year for several grassroots calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, spurring similar projects in the following year.``NEWLINE_TOKENPerhaps to be named, a calendar would have to merit its own Wiki entry, and undergo an AfD discussion.   NEWLINE_TOKEN* I do not understand why you are trying to compare TV shows with consumer products and it is disingenuous of you to want to.  MODE no longer exists, should that be expunged from the article too?  I agree to a certain point about modifying the mention of calendars, however there are good media references available for the Fenomenal Calendar and this article sorely needs every good source link it can get.  The originators of a market niche are worth noting IMO; the rest are just jumping on the bandwagon (in terms of seeking self-promotion, not in production quality or financial returns) and certainly none of them yet are at the aesthetic level of Fenomenal, no matter what opinion one may hold on the theme of the styling, size of the models, or comparisons between unrelated other print products, such as MODE Magazine for example.  Further, I do not believe it necessary for a single mention to undergo AfD or else every model named to their own paragraph on this article should do the same.  I would think that a Fenomenal weblink is appropriate because the homepage remains visible online.  This calendar does set the standard for commercially-available calendar products; in the absence of Elena Miro's calendar remaining online for people to see, which in any case was never available for purchase and should only be considered a promotional item - anything other in comparison is apples and turnips.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Suggestion: ``2007 was the launch year for several [link=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homegrown homegrown] calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, including the well-received (media reflink) Fenomenal Calendar (weblink).  These calendars have opened up a new market for the models to be seen outside of clothing advertising-only contexts, and also enabled them to capture the interest of people outside of the usual plus-size clothing consumer demographic.NEWL  : EDATA_5",dev,0

Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the ``lameness`` of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this. It's a frequent search term. One includes denial in the Holocaust entry, and there are separate entries on Holocaust denial and even Criticism of Holocaust denial  but this does not mean that we agree with Holocaust denial, does it? The occupation of the Baltic States is not universally agreed upon, no  but not too many things are universally agreed upon. Presenting the prevailing view and serious alternate views is what an encyclopedia is supposed to do. You write: Saying Baltics were not annexed is pure nonsence and extremist POV. Nobody here said that the Baltics weren't annexed  what some here are saying is that they were illegally annexed whilst under occupation, and that is indeed the prevailing view. Please follow the links I gave. That some are in denial really does not matter. Start an article on ``Denial of the occupation of the Baltic States`` if you like.  09:05`  : EDATA_5",dev,0

The reason why, in general, is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of 'written records', as the Wikipedia article on ``History`` will even state.  There can be probably some fudging, because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events.  In short, history and pre-history will be divided by written records.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease take a look at the wikipedia article on History of England, in that, the upper-right table indicates prehistory is before 43 BC, and history in the years after.  This date of 43 BC is generally due to Roman era records.  And again, (somewhere geographicaly closer to Japan) in the article History of China, the article begins by saying that ``The history of China is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 BC``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think it's a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100,000 years ago, because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence, then why stop there?  History will blend right into pre-history, and then into archaeology, without any meaningful demarcation.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is the more casual usage of the word 'history', of course.  That is, history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end.  In which case, the history of Japan goes back to the Big Bang and all time afterward.  But as an informative and scholarly Wikipedia entry, I think this article should be amended with something more accurate, more specific, referring to what is canonically defined as ``history``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI propose something like NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The earliest records of Japan date back to 600 B.C.E., according to the Chinese source commonly known as the  Gishiwajinden, or the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms.  In the text, the country of Yamataikoku is mentioned, which was said to be ruled by the Queen Himiko.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think this adds to the quality of the article in its specificity, and in exposing the reader to the Himiko story.  Even here, there is lots of controversy as to whether Yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence.  The idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100,000 BCE, as the word 'history' demands, is somewhat unreasonable.  Any comments?

Thus, as I said on Talk, I'm going to stick with helping Ling.Nut get his rewrite ready. I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensus-forming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions, etc. If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard, I would appreciate it. And it's probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed version(s) will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me.

I would also add that the statement by HJ Mitchell about how many blocks he has was less than compelling for me. It scared me a little actually. If he has that many blocks there is absolutely no way that all of those are valid. There is absolutely no way there weren't mistakes made and there is no way that he hasn't driven off editors. 13000+ blocks, quite frankly, reflects an admin who is too trigger happy and will only get worse with the checkuser when they can just arbitrarily look up any IP or editor at will. What also bothers me, as can be seen in the Protonk situation is the decision that no talk page message was needed no discussion, no nothing.

There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under ``Trivia`` and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPart of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say ``Fall Classic Portal``?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the ``Background`` section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCutting to the chase: All this WS ``Trivia`` is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of ``labels`` could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPostscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits ``on the road`` and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research?

I am also against the idea of averaging the amounts given by the sources or picking the most frequently cited amount, since this system would be open to manipulation by adding more sources.  My solution would be to rank using the lowest common denominator; case in point:  some sources say GI Joe cost $170m, and some $175m, but while the figures don't match they both agree that the film cost at least $170m.  In view of that, my suggestion would be to rank off the lower amount, but include the higher amount as an alternative estimate.

Yes because, well, it's a technical decision made by the developers; they change the config files at the direction of their bosses, the userrights change. In theory, it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. In practise - look, I've been an editor for 6+ years now, most of those as just an editor (I've been contracted here for, I think, 9 months and change). I know how silly a decision that'd be, both for practical reasons (people would get totally up in arms about it, and for good reason) and ethical ones (we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can, because we're a bottom-up organisation, not a top-down one). So generally speaking, I think editors should be able to disagree and I think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. That's what I believe, and that's why I held that RfC.NEWLINE_TOKEN:That's also why arguing with me is likely to be futile ). Not because this is a WMF decision, not because this is my staff account, but because we asked people what they want and they said ``give this to rollbackers too``. I believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the community's opinion on the subject, and that it's much more applicable than the 2008 RfC, which was held when the community was in a much different state, addressing an (in some respects) radically different question, and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. So I'm not going to be persuaded by appeals to that, and it's not me you should be looking to persuade - if you want the situation to change, as said, hold your own. If you don't want to do that, I'm stuck in a situation, hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to, where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity. And I'm not going to do that.   13:59`  : EDATA_5",dev,0

The first image you show is of an extruded cornmeal product, or `` taco shell,`` which is baked at the factory and doesn't fit with the rest of the info.  For example, the patented fryer you describe is not for these extruded shells   if they're fried, they're tortillas, if they're these shells, they are not fried.  So, that image doesn't work here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2.  The term, ``hard-shell taco``  I was born and raised in California and have lived in Arizona and on the East Coast, and I can't say I've ever seen anything called a ``hard-shell taco`` on a menu.  Is this a regional designation, possibly in the Northeast where the fryer was patented?  If so, you need to state that and cite a source.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany small, non-ethnic restaurants serve these extruded products just because they are labor free and can be stored almost indefinitely. but they just call them tacos.

If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim ``invaders``.NEWLINE_TOKEN Also  The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name `` Wišnasp`` and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. NEWLINE_TOKENThe most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that.

Shifting the noinclude tag to the end of the previous line cured that problem. The box itself was too big and overlapped with other boxes and with text in sentences above the box. (And it was a bit overbearing and distracting to the reader.) I did a re-design to make it smaller, and wrapped the box formatting only around the word ``More`` in the template, so it would be the same color as the link text.

The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate.

Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the ``Personal life`` section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon).

Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the ``Unofficial symbols`` sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables.

He takes disastrous photos of authors.  Taking more unflattering photos could hardly be possible (See Edmund White, A.M. Homes, Francine Prose, Kathryn Harrison, Mary Gaitskill).  It's gotten to the point that authors he hasn't assaulted yet with his camera are afraid to go to readings for fear he'll be there, waiting for them.   I don't spend much time on Wikipedia, but when I come upon an author's page with a terrible photo, I now know it's been taken by David Shankbone.  I became curious about how these authors felt about the photos he'd taken of them, so I went and looked back in the history of a couple of them.  First I checked in the history of A.M. Homes, and sure enough, someone tried to take down the Shankbone photo (possibly even A.M. Homes herself or someone close to her), saying it was not a good photo, and he repeatedly put it back.  I also looked in the history of Sharyn November, and she herself had an exchange with him on one of their talk pages saying she preferred another photo of herself instead, but he would not let her have her way, and I don't remember the details, but his attitude was unpleasant and bossy.  She quickly backed down sweetly. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few days ago I came upon yet another disastrous author photo by David Shankbone and decided to Google his name, because I've been thinking that sooner or later an article will inevitably come out in the print media about authors' frustrations with this offensive photographer.  I wanted to see if any articles had been published yet about it.  I didn't dig very deeply but did find that on February 18th, 2008, lots of Wikipedia editors wrote about their frustrations with David Shankbone (in a section called: Does Wikipedia want David Shankbone or should we just tell him to leave?), to the point that he promised he'd leave Wikipedia (he shouldn't make promises he won't keep-he didn't even leave for one day, as far as I can see from his list of contributions).   All those posts from upset people have been deleted from Wikipedia, but I was able to find them by going into the history of the page: Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAuthors are not the only celebrities Shankbone has upset.  I came upon discussions (on Wikipedia) about the actor Mike Farrell, who was upset by the photo Shankbone took of him, but Shankbone insisted his photo stay up on Farrell's page (it has now been replaced by a much better photo taken by someone else).  And I'm sure it's happened to countless other “notables”.  Many notable authors who are distressed by their photo will just remain quiet and try not to look at their Wikipedia pages, either because they don't know how to take down photos and post messages on Wikipedia, or because they fear that fighting David Shankbone will be futile and will  only increase their distress.  NEWLINE_TOKENAuthors are often shy and insecure about their physical appearance.  Why make it worse?  And why be stubborn and nasty about it to the few authors who do muster up the courage to request that an unflattering photo be taken down? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs with any contributor to Wikipedia, David Shankbone should have no right to assert that his photos take precedence over the photos of others, especially when more appropriate pictures are available and copyright free.  He claims that he has allowed better pictures to take the place of his, but this is clearly not true in many instances, given the way he fights to retain his pictures even in instances when any reasonable third party observer would agree that another picture is either better or more appropriate for the article.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDavid Shankbone might be using Wikipedia to try and make a career for himself, and maybe that's okay, but he's hurting a lot of people along the way.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am an author, with a few published books, and there is a page on me on Wikipedia.  That's why I care about this issue.   I'm appalled at what David Shankbone is doing to authors.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I don't know the best place to post this message, I'm posting it in three places: David Shankbone's talk page, Jimbo Wales' talk page, and Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.

556867841.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Are you quoting somebody there, or is this your own list. I'll try to address the points raised:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: 1) ``Hearsay`` is rumour received from others that one did not personally hear oneself. That does not describe Table Talk, which is essentially a primary, contemporary source of edited notes taken down by scribes. Mein Kampf I believe was also began as a text dictated by Hitler, rather than written by Hitler - is that hearsay too? And what of notes taken by Speer - is that ``hearsay``? (Interesting you note that Bormann was anti-Catholic. Why then would a ``devout Catholic`` as you term Hitler, appoint an ``anti-Catholic`` as his Private Secretary and the defacto Deputy Fuehrer?)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::2) Multiple translations - a valid issue to raise, but given that Hitler and his henchman all, strangely enough, conversed in German, we are dependent on translations in all cases - whether it be Mein Kampf, Inside the Third Reich, or Table Talk. The fact that authors like Kershaw, Bullock, Encyclopedia Brittanica and Toland all quote from Table Talk is evidence of its essential bone fides - though if you are aware of alternative translations provided by reliable sources, please do present them (or bracket them as ``also translated as``).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::3) The ``bias`` of the translators. Can you provide reliable sources for this please.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::4) I do not know what you mean by ``the Table Talk thoughts do not occur in other private or public conversations``. Table Talk contains all sorts of quotes which are reinforced by other sources! To pluck one from the countless options: Speer (whom you view as a reliable source) says that Hitler made ``harsh pronouncements against the churches to his political associates in Berlin`` and specifically notes that Bormann relished to take down Hitler's harshest comments on the Churches. Goebbels diary (per Kershaw & others) is another source, confirming Hitler's thinking on the Church Struggle. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::5) You say ``Nowhere does Hitler denounce Jesus or his own brand of Christianity``. This comment seems to suggest that you are indeed willing to accept the validity of at least some of the Table Talk text. Good. So please note: the text says Hitler believed ``it is certain that Jesus was not a Jew`` and that the Apostle Paul ``falsified`` Jesus' doctrine. These alone are the words of a heretic, not a ``devout Catholic``. Agreed? As a sign of good faith, it would help at this point if you renounced the claim that Hitler was a ``devout Catholic``. Beyond this, the transcripts are thoroughly peppered with denunciations of Christianity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: 6) The anti-Christian pronouncements contained in Table Talk are entirely consistent with the Nazi efforts to promote positive Christianity as a substitute for Christianity. The renunciation of the Bible and Jewish origins of Jesus (which ``positive Christianity`` entailed) was to give him a ``false birth certificate`` as Cardinal Michael Faulhaber put it in 1933, and the notion of the myth of blood and soil was, as Pope Pius XI wrote in Mit brennender Sorge in 1937, entirely inconsistent with Catholicism and Christianity more broadly: ``The peak of the revelation as reached in the Gospel of Christ is final and permanent. It knows no retouches by human hand; it admits no substitutes or arbitrary alternatives such as certain leaders pretend to draw from the so-called myth of race and blood``. Hitler, plainly was not in ``good standing with the Church of Rome`` in 1937!   `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

If you double the table at each step, then for a given n the rehashing will have cost at most 1 + 2 + ... + n/4 + n/2 + n which is strictly less then 2*n, thus the O(n) complexity. The same holds for any exponential growth, like increasing table size by 25% which would be more sensible for very large tables as you want to avoid large jumps in memory use for a very small variation of the input size.

Second, the AP article notes there is ``remaining radioactive debris`` at Tuwaitha.  I'm not sure if you've been on the ground (I leave that possibility open) but unless you have a source to back up your point, the AP article reads like there is other material there that are radiological.

Please note, however, that not all of them were included in the recently suggested revision. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for the even younger authors, Yisroel Nekrasov is widely published in literary periodicals in Israel, USA and Russia and his first book collection is scheduled to appear within next few weeks in Moscow (selections of his original poetry can be read in the online magazine ``Der Bavebter Yid`` and on . Boris Kotlerman's original prose was published in two major Yiddish literary periodicals in Israel (at least twice in each one of them). Haike Beruriah Wiegand's poetry appeared in ``Bavebter Yid`` and soon in ``Yerusholaimer Almanakh`` in Jerusalem (see a small selection of her highly sophisticated verse at ). Perhaps a special case could be made for retaining their names in this entry for it is not all that easy for a contemporary Yiddish author to publish her or his work in a separate book no matter how well known and well received that work might be among contemporary Yiddish readers.

I'm pretty sure the following declaration is nonsense from a sientific point of view (emphasis mine): The overtones are a result of using an alloy consisting of multiple metals, each producing its own overtone. New bowls can also produce multiple harmonic overtones if they are high quality bronze, but many are made from a simpler alloy and produce only a principal tone and one harmonic overtone. I have heard a cast iron bowl with a very impressive rich tone - and that is a very simple alloy...NEWLINE_TOKEN* Additionally the term ``aging process`` in the following paragraph and the last sentence of the section ``Antique singing bowls`` needs a sientific explanation: The aging process greatly improves the tone and centuries old antiques produce an incredibly rich and beautiful sound. I'm pretty sure the beautifully sounding antique singing bowls were sounding equally rich at their producing time. You don't find lousy antique bowls today because as soon as their metal worth exceeded their beauty or practical worth as a container at any time in the past they were molten down.NEWLINE_TOKEN  ulanNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_5",dev,0

453007464.0,"SDATA_5 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKimberly Billett NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile first reading this article I was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am also studying astronomy in which we are studying Newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. That being said, I think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing, for instance, the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by 3^2 and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.  : EDATA_5",dev,0

As a result, the same form of inappropriate content keeps creeping back in with new excuses. I think it's more the case that some people are too keen to ``babysit`` this article and try to make it grow, rather than let it breathe for a few weeks/months. I can understand editors being protective of articles they've just created for a while - but there comes a point when they have to stop ``updating`` with bloat and trivial sources, for the sake of it. An author can't visit a bookshop everyday with a new edition of their book to sell, nor can authors here expect to introduce new content daily unless the article is a genuine ``current event``. As far as I can tell, the notability of this article is low, perhaps questionable. However, I think it better that people leave the article as is for a while - better to have low notability than introduce elements that destroy it altogether and give grounds to AFD. If they can do that, then no, there should be no further disputes, and COI is no longer a matter to highlight via the tag.  [ • RFF] `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

However, I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article: it suffer from sounding very personal, and has a tone of what one would expect a non-scholar explaining something in emphatic language. (the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the ``for the benefit of Europeans``, which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and ``acceptable`` (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - ``New Agey``. (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs this is a very interesting subject, I'm looking forward to seeing how the article develops. ) Best of luck.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_5",dev,0

It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.

Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

649747063.0,"SDATA_5 :  Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENNo, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns.

I think the previous version of the article attempts to put Judd in a rather ``heroic`` role by saying that he pushed boundaries and was willing to shrug off industry standards to get his point across.

He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either. The article should be neutral, but that fact is a critical facet of Winick's career. ``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don’t agree. It COVERS the issue already. You’re asking for an opinion. I’ve been told, several times, that THAT isn’t the point of this site.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, ``Winick's penchant for gay characters``. Why JUST talk about gays? I mean, is it because  he get PRESS about them?  He’s got LOTS of other people in his comics. But if you’re mentioning GAYS because it’s gotten media coverage, then THAT is already IN the article.

When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., ``If the Earth were flat, then ...``)—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language?

I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., ``Because it rained.``). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Peace.   `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

They are not in any way sub-standard and for me they enhance the article. I am surprised by the claim that these were not agreed by other editors. Wiki publications encourage collaborative editing and nothing has to be agreed up front in this way.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:This image is clearly a photograph of another photograph, or poster, or leaflet.  Not only that, but its a badly framed snapshot, and is obviously the work of an amateur.  The image description is missing, and I do not believe that ``own work`` is satisfactory for the source field given my concerns about the image.NEWLINE_TOKEN:MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::I agree that that's a poor quality image and shouldn't be included in the article.   NEWLINE_TOKEN*Parrot, you still need to inform the image author on commons that you have nominated the image for deletion, also it would help the deletion debate if you could give any reasons for your suspicions.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegarding the other two images (right), the County Hall one seems reasonable enough, but the festival one is badly framed. The lens is too zoomed in for my liking.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The 'Oss picture conveys the feeling of the festival to me, crowded, almost claustrophobic. Would be nice if the editors who originally objectd came here themselves to give their reasons.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Note that there's also an alternative photo of the festival at File:Red obby oss party 20050502.jpg.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Which doesn't include an 'Oss.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::No, and I sense that may be important.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI still fail to see what's so terrible about these pictures. By the way, if you're going to remove pictures, please substitute better ones. That way the article is improved, rather than depleted. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGoing through them:NEWLINE_TOKEN* The Cornish language one is maybe the worst of the lot, but the reflection on the image is clearly on the ``Rooms`` banner, not on the photograph. It is difficult to find better images of Cornish language use on Wikimedia. Otherwise we're reduced to road signs which use Cornish place names - and they're really loans into English, rather than proper Cornish language use. Two other options to replace first image are on the right.NEWLINE_TOKEN* There is no way to frame the ``Obby Oss``. It takes place amongst large crowds of people, often on old streets. Other than that, I can't see what the big deal is here.NEWLINE_TOKEN* The County Hall picture is fine as far as I'm concerned. (However, if you wish a better one, there may well be one on Geograph which can be transferred onto Wikimedia.) It's a non-partisan image, and can't be accused of pandering to any political tendency.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.`` - If I wished to insult people, I'd use much stronger language! What I object to is the use of deliberately obscure (and dubious)  abbreviations to justify edits, without a decent explanation as to why. Personally I would have preferred some kind of reasoning. At least that seems to be happening just now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``obviously the work of an amateur.`` - Most of the images on Wikipedia are amateur by definition.

My editorial comments are sometimes more curt or critical than they should be, and this quite naturally elicits a strong reaction.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problem of ground pressure was well-understood by the US Army Ordnance Dept. during WWII. I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T-34's lower ground pressure, and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept. to achieve similar results.  In fact, designers of both tanks were simply reacting to the conditions imposed by the European battlefield, and the Russian's worked out the solution while the American's were still getting the M4 ready for battle in the sands of N. Africa. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKeep in mind that the relatively few engagements involving T-34s and M4s were fought mostly at relatively close ranges.  This helped mask the penetration problems of the 76mm HVAP (It was only marginally better than the AP shot round.), and led to a generalized misunderstanding of the tank's effectiveness against its Russian counterpart. I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea.  In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps, it was Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair.  A long time staffer, McNair was a genius at organization, but demonstrated very little understanding of, or for that matter, any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield.  Had he died a year earlier, we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans.  It would have made a difference.    : EDATA_5",dev,0

66123176.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy Wikipedia Can't WorkNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What's more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia's philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I'll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Ignorant Edit-BullyNEWLINE_TOKENMany people have noted this phenomenon, though I've never seen a good name for it before. In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they're particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of ``page vandalism``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they've contributed to. Any change to ``their`` page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What's worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In ``real life`` they would be harmless, as they wouldn't be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia's articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo Editors Means No Sense of the ValuableNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, ``ninety percent of everything is [crap]``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the ``edit bullies`` described above: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThey do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. NEWLINE_TOKENThey are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. NEWLINE_TOKENThey tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such NEWLINE_TOKENThis results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers, while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover. My current favourite example: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out. A few weeks later, I checked back, only to find that the article had been c  : EDATA_5",dev,0

I understand why you feel that my request for documentation ``doesn't make sense`` to you. The request needs to be understood in the context of (A) Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and (B) rules of legal analysis. What you have done is provide numerous quotations  taken out of context  from various court cases and from other sources. Many of the court cases did not even involve federal taxes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurther, assuming you are still defending the verbiage that was removed from the article, you appear to be arguing that an ``excise``  in the U.S. constitutional law sense  is limited to a tax on privileges, etc. That argument is completely invalid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are two problems with the argument. First, none of the sources you provided say that all excises (in the constitutional sense) must always involve a tax on a ``privilege,`` and none of the sources you provided stand for that proposition. Second, by contrast, I have specific federal court cases where the courts ruled various events or activities to be taxable events  yet those activities or events do not involve any ``privilege.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLater, I'll repost, on this talk page, the actual text that was removed from the article, and I will again summarize  applying Wikipedia policies and guidelines and rules of legal analysis  why the removed material was objectionable. The analysis you provided violates various Wikipedia rules, and it also violates some of the basic tenets of legal analysis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, for some more background.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe argument that an excise (in the constitutional sense), must always involve a ``privilege`` to be valid is called a ``tax protester argument.`` It is not only legally invalid, but it is worse: it is also legally frivolous. A person can be penalized monetarily for even raising such an argument on a federal tax return or in a federal court. Later, I'll also post examples of actual court cases where people specifically argued, using the ``privilege`` argument, that their income could not be taxed under the federal income tax laws, and their arguments were ruled invalid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn a separate note, it should be obvious that the argument that a excise (again, in the constitutional sense, not the statutory sense) must always involve a ``privilege``  is legally nonsensical for an entirely separate reason: Engaging in criminal activity is not a ``privilege`` in any correct legal sense. Yet, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the federal income tax (which is an excise) may validly tax the receipt of funds in a criminal activity (specific examples: funds received by extortion or embezzlement), even though the wrongdoer is required to return the funds to their rightful owner. And the federal courts have repeatedly and overwhelmingly ruled that the federal income tax is fundamentally an excise, not a direct tax. (I know of only a couple of cases off the top of my head where a federal court actually ruled a particular federal income tax to be a ``direct tax,`` and one of those cases was later overruled). On this basis alone, an ``excise`` cannot possibly be limited to ONLY a tax on a privilege, etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStay tuned.   `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

Please read very carefully what I said as a sock puppet. I am not wasting your time because there is a basic, intrinsic problem with Wikipedia as represented by this process: people do not read, people do not listen, people do not consider actual intention. I have only positive intentions for the Beat Generation page. Tao has negative intentions for the Beat Generation page. Therefore, i have negative intetions for Tao.

Please look at what I have contributed to Wikipedia in the past. Look at the Theatre of the Absurd page. I essentially wrote the whole page. Look at the Howl page. I wrote most of that page as well. Look at the Beat Generation page. I wrote very large portions of that page. The indefinite block should be very short because my intentions are very positive.

I want to say this again because I'm afraid none of you are actually reading what I'm actually saying: Please, actually read what I'm actually saying. I don't know how much plainer I can make it. Please do not be lazy with the sort of laziness that destroys Wikipedia as a source. Read the section with ``formal argument edition`` on it and tell me if that in any way represents a ``diatribe`` as Tao claims.

That section represents my genuine inention for the page, as does the ``let's get down to business`` section.

Turley said, ``There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that ``Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . .

Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is ``not a Church commission``; ``The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs.`` Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. ``Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,`` Turley said, adding that the authors will ``present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books.

I am certainly open to alternative suggestions to clarify the criterion; but I disagree about the absence of sources to define an order of magnitude quantification.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe American gun culture includes a large number of writers who emphasize opinions rather than pursuing statistics. As the internet allows anyone to screen for information sources confirming an existing bias, such authors may be well represented by conventional search-engine algorithms.

If you think the subject represented more than ten percent of the firearms or ammunition, it's probably a top importance article; but it's probably not top importance if you have doubts.

It seems you were called in to quickly ``protect`` the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited ``edit warring,`` the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   NEWLINE_TOKEN:RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were ``reliable,`` without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I strongly object to your calling me ``disinegnuous`` [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit ``sparked so much conflict and opposition`` but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is ``fair`` through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can't say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we'll see.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:``repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons`` - motive doesn't really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::The subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan.

It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be ``The people of the Sunnah``. Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010).

For some other Yadav-apologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than Rao, and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the Yadav apologists are not and have no intention, aware or unaware, of being—will go scurrying again for the article.  After that we all will try to interpret it, weighing the pros and cons, again to a degree the apologists will not, for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think we can't make the determination of whether Rao applies here or not, at least not yet.  Let the secondary sources do that.  We need to rely on recent scholarship, especially that in textbooks, published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds.  Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.  Let the article writing (or rewriting) proceed based on these (or similar) books.  Once the article has been fleshed out, we can come back to the issue of Rao.  Otherwise, nothing will get done, and those of us, who've taken time out from our other Wikipedia (not to speak RL) pursuits to attend to the article, will slowly walk away, out of touch and out of sympathy.   `  : EDATA_5",dev,1

Then, after struggling, Duffy came to the rescue, who asked his wife to send a box of pictures to Cantrell. All the pictures Duffy's real-life family were taken, decades ago (before Duffy's parents were murdered, in real-life), as well as a baby picture of Patrick, himself. His real-life mother also bore a slight resemblance to Bel Geddes, whose character made a photo of her holding baby Patrick, exactly what Cantrell needed. His real-life late parents made a cameo on the revised Dallas series.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWow.   `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

What I was saying is that its based on a bias (held by most wiki editors and people in general) against small media outlets. This is problematic because who is to say that a small media outlet such as The Con isn't notable? What makes it not notable? The fact that its small? Or the fact that it isn't mainstream? Or the fact that it is South African? Notability can be according to one's point of view. Obviously you don't think it is notable.

They were wholly unprepared for the war, having received notice that they were to fight just a few days before the 15th of May. Their logistics were poor - they had handed over a part of their munition reserves to the Arab Salvation Army, and given its scarcity of war matériel had to husband what was left. Its knowledge of the theatre of war where it was to conduct operations was minimal. It took then almost a week to get their tanks over the Jordan. Their first advance was roundly defeated, with heavy losses. On the 18th under Husni Zaim they attacked and took Samakh, south of Tiberias, only to lose it in three days after an Israeli-kibbutznik counter attack. This massive army 'with artillary, tanks, (armed?)armoured cars and airforce stocked with Harvards, (not Harvard-armed aircraft!!, which is a brilliantly comical image)' took 4 days, involving almost all that the Syrian army could muster, to capture a little  moshava like Mishmar HaYarden, with its 20 local guards (Tal p.261) which had to fight on its own, without IDF assistance.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Secondly, you really should stop this nonsense about RS bias.

Obviously, the word ``Khristós`` would not have been etched on the plates; the Nephites didn't speak Greek, just as they didn't speak French (see the end of the Book of Jacob). Joseph Smith chose to translate whichever word or character WAS written into the English word ``Christ,`` because that is how ``Christ`` is used in not only modern English, but in the English Bible itself.

Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too.

Follow the red link it creates and on that new page add {{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | text=Reason}}~~~~ where PageName is the name of the article (case sensitive) and Reason is your detailed reasoning why the article should be deleted. Finally, go to WP:AfD. There's a link marked ``Add a new entry``.

I can't be bothered looking up the relevant guidelines now but I believe they say Wikipedia doesn't have any preference except that articles should be consistent. I merely changed the first date that came to hand. It seems to me that you may have inadvertently done what you accused me of - my edit first established a BC/BCE convention and you went against that. An anon (not me) has just changed the thing back to BC now but if you want to change it to BCE again go ahead, I'm really not bothered - but do change both dates this time.

I have seen too many videos of Israeli soldiers behaving in a brutal matter to Palestinians who are already on their knees with their hands up to think that it never happens.  And likewise I dont think that a pilot fires on a building with civilians knowing it is full of them and only them, but I dont that their superiors would never order it without their knowledge.  Atrocities happen, oftentimes unintentionally, others with full intent, like My Lai Massacre, Sabra and Shatila massacre for which high ranking officers were held at least indirectly responsible, and many others.

The problem is summarized in the appendix.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENObviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Yet, students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. My reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. My impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. This is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph.D. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCompass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWorship Rights NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there.

435579776.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Maba Diakhou Bâ ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history asNEWLINE_TOKENThe Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article did not give us the exact date he died and in the ``Death and legacy`` heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting ``1876`` instead of ``1867``. I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraphNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote ``He became leader Almamy in Saloum`` and under the ``Resistance and Conquest`` heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote NEWLINE_TOKEN``While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been  : EDATA_5",dev,0

Shrek05 14:31 26 Jun 2006NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile NorthPark may not (yet) be notable nationwide, I don't see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall, for this reason:  the mall is the largest in Texas (at 2.35 million square feet) and one of the five largest in the US (according to the International Council of Shopping Centers).  Consequently, the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion.  With the 1.4-acre Center Park in the middle, NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating, playing or relaxing.

It's, in fact, a war about a couple of links. Well, the arbitration will start in 20 hours, but I'd like to suggest the last proposal: every participant recuses himself from editing the links in questioned pages for a few months, and we just leave that to other editors. The ArbCom will accept the case, but, well, a peaceful solution might be better. I've posted more on Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration#A different view. Just think about that and about whether you really need arbitration; and, if you agree with that, just sign there. It's the last chance for a peaceful resolution.

38869255.0,"SDATA_5 :  Weak support:This came to my attention when I started in doing a disambiguation back when The Nation went to The Nation (disambiguation).  It is true (this is also said above) that the majority of links which went to The Nation (disambiguation) were meant to go to The Nation (U.S. periodical).  However, I found that in all the cases where this was not true (e.g. when the Irish or Thai periodical was meant) the editors of those articles seemed to not be aware of the U.S. periodical.  (This makes sense, incidentally, as this periodical is not entirely well known even in the U.S.)  In short, the old situation was that there were a ton of links to a disambiguation page, which is to be avoided, but in this new situation, I think we'll eventually see a ton of links to simply the wrong thing, which strikes me as worse.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Moreover, a remark:  although the majority of the inbound links were meant for the U.S. periodical, I think there is a systemic bias at work here.  A vast majority of those were in bibliographies, where a web article from The Nation was referenced.  Many (almost all?) sources in Wikipedia bibliographies are web-based, and thus we should not be surprised to see a current magazine overrepresented, especially when constrasted with a 19th century publication.

One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view.

Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only ``some`` of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I'm confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNotice the non-neutrality in Saedon's message:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon's part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called ``scientific community.`` They take it seriously because it's a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo say that only ``some`` of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not scienceNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo say that only ``some`` of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon's non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI refute that claim.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It's no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

Regarding The Art of War (disambiguation), there is already a link to Sun-Tzu's book, which El Norte Press has simply issued in a new edition.  WP:DISAMBIG covers the sorts of things that are appropriate for disambiguation pages; since we wouldn't have a whole article on a single edition of a book, we wouldn't mention it on the disambiguation page.

'  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Ah, I had missed that you had said Mao's Art of War, not Sun Tzu's.  Still, Mao never wrote a book called The Art of War.  The El Norte Press edition is a compilation of four separate treatises.  They would be notable individually, but none would be linked to the Art of War disambiguation page since none of them shares that title, nor could the El Norte edition be advertised on any of the articles devoted to one of those four treatises (e.g., On Protracted War). '  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: There is a difference between editions that on their own satisfy the requirements of WP:N and the insertion of information about a specific edition into articles about a book.

If you like, you can request a third opinion, which would bring others into the discussion.  '  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Thanks for your note.  While anything written by Mao Zedong would count as notable, a collection of his writings, assembled under a title that he never chose, would not be.  It is for this reason that I am loathe to include The Art of War as one of Mao's writings or to put it on the disambiguation page.  One thing that caught my eye was your claim that this work is referenced in scholarly papers.  That would be a sign of notability.  Did Mao ever publish these works together as unit under the title, The Art of War? Who has discussed the works by this title? '  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::: Thank you again for your comments.  The fact that this edition appears in the footnote of an unpublished paper does not make it notable; blogs are not reliable sources, either.  You mention that this book is used at West Point.

I mean no disrespect when I say this, but it should be pretty obvious that a subject who played just 34 games in the NHL, the rest in the minors and senior hockey isn't going to be all that notable, which is why there isn't a long detailed article that others have.   `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

These two users constantly revert my edits with the claim that the article is too Peacock-y, and that it goes into too much depth about Ms. Michaels by detailing her rounds on the talk show circuit. I whole heartedly disagree. I think that her work on the various talk shows is some of the funniest, most impressive work of her career; and it is no small feat to appear on Ed Sullivan and The Tonight Show, let alone perform as well as she did. I hope the two editors who keep changing this article will realize this, and I encourage both of them to consider the possibility that only they, out of the countless editors on Wikipedia, have had any objections to the information on Ms. Michaels posted over the years. I don't know what their beef is with her, or if they have even seen any of her fine performances, but it would be appropriate for them to learn more about her before destroying the information about her on this free online encyclopedia.     : EDATA_5",dev,0

406750714.0,"SDATA_5 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::First of all I have nothing against you or Rouvas (who is an artist I actually like) in case there is a misunderstanding. I read the changes and I have to admit that you did a very good job... but I still think you exagerate in general about Rouvas. He's not perfect in everything as the whole bio clearly slows. And the movie Sta Akra (because I live in Greece) was not a BIG box office hit... Don't live in a bubble. And in the article there's only one positive review from Zoumboulakis praising his performance and the movie itself. In this case only one review means that his performance was indeed good and proves a point and many ``random reviews`` cannot prove that a movie was good or bad in the case of Alter Ego? (and let's face it... it was a really bad movie, but that's my opinion). You repeatedly put info in the Anna Vissi article, stating her commercial decline. Apagorevmeno sold 27.000 units (2x platinum) and it was her lowest selling album. You can't say that. I believe Rouvas' ``Parafora`` certified double platinum, or am I wrong? I am not sure. But if it's true how many units did he sold. There must be around 25.000 units or more, right? That means it's his lowest selling album, right? If it is I didn't see you writing on his article!!! So, some things apply for Vissi and not for Rouvas. I think it's unfair and you're being highly impartial. Not to mention that Rouvas never made huge sellings (like 7 platinum that Vissi did) but he still is a big selling artist so his decline cannot be that obvious like Vissi and Vandi. (I really hope you get my point and what exactly I'm trying to say to you). So it's not easy or even possible to reach a 7 platinum status again in someone's career and especially in this period. I'm not mad about anything especially for a bad review that concerns Vissi. I'm used to it. To me it sounds really bad when someone uses the word ``decline`` in an article because some reporter decided it is so. Anyway I'm sorry if I seemed a little mean (I'm not, really!!!). and one question: do you speak greek?  `  : EDATA_5",dev,0

From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion.

I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) This is new. It's from Conason: ``Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments.`` Wow!

But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis quote is also troubling: ``Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing.`` Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:NEWLINE_TOKEN``Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhady'a say?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Much more on this section later.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are ``not as bright`` as men'?NEWLINE_TOKENSome editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected.

He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims and their actions, suggesting that a more accurate term would be ``Anti-Muslimism.``[34] Poole responds by noting that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims.[35][36] Halliday also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis. Miles and Brown respond by arguing that ``the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.``[35] Halliday argues that the concept of Islamophobia unwittingly plays into the hands of extremists.[34]NEWLINE_TOKENBritish writer and academic Kenan Malik believes that the charge of Islamophobia confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is frequently and allows for a culture of victimhood, where all failings are attributed to Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system.[37] This analysis is criticized by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain and Abdul Wahid from the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.[38] Bunglawala writes that Malik's argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims, without recognizing less overt forms of prejudice or discrimination. By ignoring non-violent examples of Islamophobia, Malik's commentary ``makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against,`` according to Bunglawala.[38]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, a group of 12 writers signed a statement in the French weekly satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in March 2006, warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of ``Islamic totalitarianism``. The novelist Salman Rushdie was among these signatories.[39] These views are shared by Dutch law professor Afshin Ellian.[40] Critics cite the case of British journalist Polly Toynbee, who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of ``Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year`` at the 'Annual Islamophobia Awards' overseen by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, for claiming that Islam ``... imposes harsh regimes that deny the most basic human rights.``[41]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an article called ``Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics``, Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that ``One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise.`` She also chides some ``people on the left`` for using the same ``Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime``. She concludes with the statement ``At times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against Islamophobia.``[42]NEWLINE_TOKENJohann Hari of The Independent has criticized the use of the term by organizations like Islamophobia Watch, arguing that liberal Muslims interested in reform are le  : EDATA_5",dev,1

Now, most of these people are frustrated and confused. They don't understand that it is not a decision the ranger at the barrier made, which is keeping them from entering, but a decision made by the leaders of the nation. When one of the leaders of the nation who caused the incident berates a person making barely above minimum wage, basically at one of the lowest levels of authority over that opening or closing decision, OVER AN INCIDENT HE HIMSELF CREATED that is an unprecedented level of hypocrisy and posturing for the cameras. He thought he'd look like a defender of the veterans, and fool people who couldn't reason well enough to realize he caused the very situation. He told that woman that SHE should be ashamed for doing her job as he and his fellow politicians directed. How dare he tell her to be ashamed for his actions?

There are no other names. Perhaps (I am not an expert on this author by any means) he added the name ``Richards`` at some point, but it was certainly not a part of his official name and indeed the author's marriage in 1914 is also registered as ``David Herbert Lawrence`` (this can also be verified on the same website).

I have read the article and while it is a worthy student essay, it is not encyclopaedic in tone and as well as the editorialisng there are errors. The discussion on rotavirus immediately grabbed my attention. It's about 20 years out of date and is sourced to a 1985 paper by de Zoysa and Feachem. This publication was important and influential at the time but has long been superseded. There has been major progress in prevention of rotaviral diarrhoea in the past 15 or so years, which the article completely ignores. It has also been known for some time that improved social conditions do little to control the incidence and prevalence of viral gastroenteritis and this is why the WHO, many years ago, supported vaccine development. I'm not convinced that there is much here – once it has been updated and the editorial comments removed – that is not already covered in our other articles which include Gastroenteritis, Rotavirus and Rotavirus vaccine.  While I applaud the contributor's enthusiasm for a subject that has been the main thrust of my research in real life, I think the salient points of this article should be merged with Gastroenteritis if they are not already covered.

Conspiracy theorists is a word frequency used and accepted but i guess the admins do not threat everyone in the same way or they just want to have a excuse to remove posts and block editors. Everytime i discovered that some of the sources in the moon hoax article is using misleading propaganda im not even allowed to say it without actions is taken to me - thats IS censorship and it should not be accepted.`  : EDATA_5,dev,0

Fairness did.  If you cannot understand the difference between the two, then this is going to be very difficult.

In terms of article editing, I would prefer if you waited a bit, but blocks aren't intended to be punitive, so if you're okay with abiding by WP:3RR you can go ahead and edit as you feel is appropriate.

Note that you have not been blocked from editing directly.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::I can't edit from the computers at work, but can at home. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::That was due to a lingering autoblock on your work IP from the 3RR block. I tried to find and remove the autoblock, but the autoblock-finding tool wasn't showing any. As it turns out, the autoblock finder was malfunctioning. I apologize for that - I tried to undo the autoblock, but was stymied by technical problems which I am only now becoming aware of.
