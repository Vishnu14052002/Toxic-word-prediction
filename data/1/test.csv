And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Ramesses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Ancient Egypt isn't something you have studied intensively there may be some confusion about what is a treasure city. A treasure city or emporia is a port where foreign traders can bring their goods through customs. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the 19th century archaeologists made speculations about San el-Hagar or Pi-Ramesses and Tell el-maskhuta or Pi-Athom  being the places mentioned in the story of the Exodus. These have since been corrected by trained Egyptologists, but the myths have lived on among ``biblical archaeologists`` and laypeople.

Monet, the greatest expert on the Tanis monuments  to believe this was the site of the ancient Pi-Ramesses, the delta capital of the Ramesids. Nevertheless none of the buildings so far excavated can be shown to have been built before the reign of Pausanes I of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt and the inescapable conclusion therefore is that all the ramessid and earlier monuments must have been brought from other places.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnder Tell el-maskhutaNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1883 E. Neville excavated a large brick built enclosure (some 210 x 210 m) with a badly damaged temple at Tell el-maskhuta, in wadi tumilat. (In the late period a canal through this wadi enabled  ships to sail from the Nile into the Red Sea) Most scholars, though not all, identify Tell el-maskhuta with ancient Egyptian Tjeku and Pithom, (probably from per-Atum, The ``Domain of Athom``) of the Exodus and the capital of the Eighth Lower Egyptian nome.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPithom is an ancient city in Egypts delta. Its mentioned in Exodus as a treasure city in the same breath as Ramesses. You would have to know that from the Hyksos period onward there are emporia in both the delta and Thebes. In the delta cities like Sais served as ``Treasure cities`` business or banking centers. At Thebes Elim on the Red Sea also served as a business or banking centers for the Red Sea trade in Frankincense, Myhr, Bitumen and perfumes and ointments such as ben jamin or juniper oil used at Karnak's mortuary temples.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPithom and Rameses are located at opposite ends of the kingdom. Pi-Athom is an ancient nome capital (see below) in the delta. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRa mes ses means literally (Ra=sun), (mes=birth), (ses= to guard or observe), the place of observing the birth of the sun, the dawn in the east. During the entire history of Egypt the Red Sea was an important source of the materials used in the mortuary at Karnak. Karnak was where Moses would have gone to get the bones of JosephNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENExodus 13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

She may well have a 5-octave range, but singers are defined by their *effective* range, not merely the pitch boundaries of their natural range (including the falsetto). However, Carey is a phenomenal singer regardless of her full range. Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no MC. )NEWLINE_TOKEN    : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's ``Meet the Press`` that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.``I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,`` Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, ``I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,`` the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be ``a little awkward`` for him back in Washington.``They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,`` Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.``I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' `` he said.``I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,`` Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (``D.``)] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36`  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

After reading about Aussinanis and writing a message to you, I clicked on the Uranium mines in Namibia link and now realize you have made all the entries there. May I point out some detail that might just be important as far as Wikipedia is concerned. There is a major distinction between a mine and an exploration project. Currently only Rössing, Langer Heinrich, Trekkopje and Husab can be called mines. Husab is in the process of construction, so one can call it a mine. Valencia is called a mine because there is a signboard on the road that says ``Valencia mine``, but they never advanced beyond the mid-exploration phase. The reality is that none of the other projects are further than advanced exploration. Even Trekkopje is technically still constructing, but have actually shut down because of the poor economy. Some of the Reptile projects (e.g. Omahola) and Zhonge Resources have received mining licences but it is unlikely that they will be developed soon; the uranium price is far too low for economical extraction and will remain like that for some time to come.NEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

The claims that this photograph is a photograph of Baha'u'llah are false. The person in this photograph bears no physical resemblance to the personage in the photograph on display in the archives.

THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is.

Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being  conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball. So in my book her birthday would fall in the same class as that of Abraham Lincoln (Kentucky, February 12, 1809 — Washington, D.C., April 15, 1865).     : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

NEWLINE_TOKENPosted 9/12/2006 9:40 PM ET NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInternet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are. NEWLINE_TOKEN``Well, you know, his company was vulnerable to The Innovator's Dilemma, especially because he didn't have a World Is Flat strategy, although he could've seen it coming if he'd tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, the concept of ``the wisdom of crowds`` — the title of a popular 2004 book by James Surowiecki — is particularly hot among tech companies right now. Yet in the past week, the concept has run into a couple of potholes. One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg.com; the other, the U.K. government's case of the hijacked wiki. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBoth have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise, and what conditions have to exist to make them wise. Why is it that some crowds seem smart, while others turn into ugly mobs? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt its most basic level, the wisdom of crowds — let's call it WOC, so I don't have to type as much — means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe WOC has been around forever — it's what democratic elections try to tap into. But the Net takes it to a whole new level. ``The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and cost-effective way,`` Surowiecki tells me. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo if a company can use the Net to tap the collected intelligence of its employees, the employees will make better decisions than the CEO. IBM, Google and others have tried this. Wikipedia, written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributors, should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists. News sites such as Digg, which lets users vote stories to the front page, should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENExcept it doesn't always work that way. Pointing specifically at Wikipedia, Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Net has propagated a ``basic fallacy that a wisdom-of-crowds approach could ever work, even theoretically.``   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhich might be extreme. But clearly some of the WOC mechanisms in use today have shortcomings. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTake Digg. Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise: If you like a news item or blog post, you can ``digg`` it by voting for it. Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page. But cabals of users started working together to boost certain items. Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1,000 or so savvy members. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo last week, Rose changed the formula. Digg will use computer programs to try to devalue bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking. Digg's regulars revolted, causing a big Web stink. But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The thing that makes the wisdom of crowds work is lots of diverse opinions and independent judgments,`` Surowiecki says. ``Digg acknowledged it wanted more diversity of input.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo WOC needs the right structure to work, something the U.K.'s Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) found out the hard way. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts, so it posted one on the Net as a wiki. The idea of a wiki — such as Wikipedia — is that anyone can log on and add or change something. In the case of DEFRA's wiki, the public mutilated it. In one of the more printable alterations, someone changed ``Who are the parties to the environmental contract`` to ``Where is the party for the environmental contract? Can I come? Will there be cake? Hooray!`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``These sorts of issues have permeated the Net,`` Weinstein says. ``Part of the problem is ... it doesn't take a lot of people to cause such disruptions.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikis, as it turns out, are not so much tapping the WOC as they are works in constant progress. Depending on who last wrote something, at any one time the wiki might be good, or bad. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDespite hiccups, though, there's still a lot of enthusiasm for WOC. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGoogle, in its own way, is a WOC device. It analyzes links that millions of people put on websites to come up with the most relevant search results.

Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).) Yes, I know that there are many sources claiming that the djembe and dunun came from Ghana (or Benin), but those claims are simply incorrect, and there is plenty of literature from reputable source to show this.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::As to Mamady Keita being a reputable source, that is something beyond dispute: he is one of the most respected and famous masters world-wide, Malinke, and grew up in a traditional village.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::What has happened here is that a lot of people who don't have the cultural background have copied from each other. This is unfortunate, but continued mis-use of a term doesn't make it correct, unless the use has entered the vernacular to such a point that it becomes valid. (Djun djun is nowhere near that common use.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::When I first learned about the ``djun djun`` issue, I made it a point to pay attention to this. I have spent extensive time (many months) in West Africa studying with a number of masters there, including in Ghana and Mali. Not once have I heard native speakers there (either Ghana or Mali) refer to the drum as ``djun djun``. I also have already asked old and young master drummers specifically about this. Famoudou Konate, Mohamed Bangoura, Epizo Bangoura, Lansana Camara, Isaac ``Tuza`` Afutu, and Aliou Sylla (all teachers of mine) have all told me that no such word exists.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I believe it is beyond any doubt that ``djun djun`` is a misnomer. The only question is what do with the djun djun page. A redirect to dunun is incorrect IMO because it would implicitly legitimize the incorrect term as a synonym. So, I would still like to retain the page but I don't know what I would have to do to bring the page up to acceptable standard. Can you help me here? A big problem when writing about Malinke instruments and drumming culture is that there is little material in writing. Most of the information is passed verbally from master to student. And, as far as I know, I cannot simply create a citation saying something like ``Famoudou Konate, June 2011, personal communication``?   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that ``according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction``). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Context Note: The discussion here refers to the user's comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bosniakophobia. He had posted a bolded ``Do not delete`` on three separate occasions, and I struck two of them out for the sake of clarity when the AfD was going to be closed. He still has one of his three ``votes`` (inasmuch as they are in fact votes), which is as many as everyone else involved. The ``more detailed explanation`` to which he refers isn't in fact present, as it is in fact roughly 50% of a longer explanation that he had already posted. Again, in the interests of clarity, I struck this out.  -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Okay ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENConcerning your comments on my TalkPage, now that you gave enought explanation, fair enough.NEWLINE_TOKENAlthough I wish you somehow merged all comments together instead of crossing them, but anyways. I see that Serbs are winning against nomination of Bosniakophobia as an article @ Wikipedia. What Serbs did BigHaz, and you need to understand this from factual and fair view of perspective, they (Serbs) invented word ``Serbophobia``, then nominated her on Wikipedia, and other Serbs came and voted ``YES! Keep it!`` and now thousands of ``wikipedia scrapper pages`` are basicly spreading this word as a cancer over the internet. So, let's delete both Bosniakophobia and Serbophobia, because NONE of these words is in English dictionary ! So why keep Serbophobia? Why? Please tell me your reasoning. Please! Thanks.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I would have merged the comments if there'd been anything to merge. As it was, one comment was a duplicate of the other, which meant that there was precisely nothing which could gainfully have been merged. In terms of Serbophobia, you'll note that I have not expressed any opinion at all in that AfD (even I have my limits when it comes to the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics). However, I will investigate the matter further, since you've asked.  -  NEWLINE_TOKEN::Contextual Postscript: Having looked into the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics slightly further in the interests of making sure that I wasn't shooting off my mouth about something that multiple people were doing, I noticed at the Serbophobia AfD that the above user had in fact done much the same thing that he'd done at the Bosniakophobia discussion - although with the opposite intention. I repeated the process of striking the duplicate ``delete`` votes. One of the delete votes had a relatively long and potentially important rationale attached, so I didn't strike it. Of course, anything that's struck out is still patently visible to a closing admin or contributing user, and more legible via the editing screen if legibility is a problem. One of these days I'm going to have to make good my promise to myself of learning Serbo-Croatian.  -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Lakes United==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have added information to the article in an effort to establish notability.

Norcross.  NEWLINE_TOKENThe novel chronicles the story of Ezzie, his obsession with a woman and the city in which he lives.  NEWLINE_TOKENThe novel is told in the first person with a prose-like narrative and a seemingly honest attention to detail.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Summary==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story begins on New Years Eve, in Times Square, New York City.

The tension thickens when Carmen ultimately decides to attend a school in Europe and possibly leave Ezzie in the city, alone once again. http://norcrossmedia.com/blog/category/the-violin-diary/NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe publisher's description is actually an excerpt from a previously published review by Shane Pitkin Barden.  The excerpt of the review & description reads:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The Violin Diary relates two love affairs - one with a woman, one with New York. Both seem to mirror the author’s perception of The City, that “Life in New York always seemed to be moving back and forth, up and down - up and down, back and forth like violin notes; notes that are impressively changing and always dramatic.” Perhaps what is most memorable about this story are the thoughts Norcross poses and then ponders. And there are myriad statements that gave me pause when I read them; some because they are concise gems, others because they document simple gestures that hint of epic proportion when I tilted my perception ever so slightly. While The Violin Diary, on the surface, is a compilation of memories, it is really about one’s heart: where it starts, where it ends, and everything in between. It’s the journey - the everything in between - that matters most because it is what truly defines us.`` http://multi-mediareviews.blogspot.com/2008/10/violin-diary-by-eric-norcross-review-by.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Characters==NEWLINE_TOKEN===Major characters===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Ezzie - A young, mid-twenties artist and the narrator of the story.

A few points if I may. I'm new to this so I'm not really good at. I don't think you hate me and I see how much obviously better the article is with your edits. So I'm actually grateful. You are really good at this, I'm not but I'd like to learn. So seeing the changes that you made to my original, I can't help but agree they improved the article, every one of them. So no complaints here.You have my thanks. Just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions. I really had no agenda. I don't know Bridget Taylor, I wasn't promoting her in the sense of I think she needs to be promoted. If I was promoting her it's more because I have become a huge user of wikipedia myself. It's become the first place I go to research any subject, person, place or thing. Given that, I totally respect the fact you are such a great editor. As a user of the information provided here, I also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive, fact filled, current, and factual. So again, I am not offended by the need for editing; rather I welcome it. Getting back to my agenda. I became aware of Bridget Taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background. I found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of ABA therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults. My sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia. When the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism, they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child. I've learned in my research that Taylor 's work and practice are of the utmost importance, especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed. The Alpine Learning Group is arguably (but not many would argue the point) the best placement for an autistic child in the country. So given what I had learned from my research I just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that Taylor just be listed in wikipedia. Honestly, I'm without agenda. In fact, I'm not a ``fan`` of ABA therapy. It is, however, the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn. Which is a valuable thing. A parent can use dietary supplements, adjunct therapies, etc. which I totally support. In the meantime while waiting to see the results, there is a small window of opportunity when a child's brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age. That window goes from maybe 3-6 years old. So, to me, it seems very important to use what we have available (ABA therapy) so that child, all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

76054849.0,"SDATA_1 :  `I think the following better captures the nature of the Investigations. The first two pargarphs have not been changed but the final three are completely different. Comments please.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough the Tractatus is a major work, Wittgenstein is mostly studied today for the Philosophical Investigations (Philosophische Untersuchungen). In 1953, two years after Wittgenstein's death, the long-awaited book was published in two parts. Most of the 693 numbered paragraphs in Part I were ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from the publisher. The shorter Part II was added by the editors, G.E.M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees. (Had Wittgenstein lived to complete the book himself, some of the remarks in Part II would likely have been incorporated into Part I, and the book would no longer have this bifurcated structure.)NEWLINE_TOKENIt is notoriously difficult to find consensus among interpreters of Wittgenstein's work, and this is particularly true of the Investigations. Very briefly, Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language and its uses as sets of language-games within which the parts of language function and have meaning in order to resolve the problems of philosophy. This view of language represents what many consider a break from the Wittgenstein in the Tractatus and, hence, meaning as representation. In the carrying out of such an investigation, one of the most radical characteristics of the ``later`` Wittgenstein comes to light. The ``conventional`` view of philosophy's ``task``, perhaps coming to a head in Bertrand Russell, is that the philosopher's task is to solve the seemingly intractable problems of philosophy using logical analysis (for example, the problem of ``free will``, the relationship between ``mind`` and ``matter``, what is ``the good`` or ``the beautiful`` and so on). However, Wittgenstein argues that these ``problems`` are, in fact, ``bewitchments`` that arise from the philosophers' misuse of language.NEWLINE_TOKENOn Wittgenstein's account, language is woven into the fabric of life, and it is within this ordinary everyday context that language actually operates. Philosophical problems arise, on this account, when language is forced out of the everyday context that is its proper home, and is forced into a new, metaphysical, environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks have been deliberately removed. Removed for what appear to be sound philosophical reasons, but which are, for Wittgenstein, the very source of the problem. Wittgenstein describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice; where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language (the language of the Tractatus), and where all philosophical problems can be solved without the confusing and muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, just because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no actual work at all. There is much talk in the Investigations, then, of “idle wheels,” and language being “on holiday”, all of which are used to express this same idea of what is lacking in philosophical contexts. To resolve the problems encountered there, Wittgenstein argues, philosophers must “bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.” That is, philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the “rough ground” of ordinary language in use. NEWLINE_TOKENReturning to the rough ground is, however, easier said than done. Philosophical problems having the character of depth, and running as deep as the forms of language and thought that have become habitual for the philosopher. Wittgenstein therefore speaks of “illusions” and “conjuring tricks” performed on our thinking by our forms of language and tries to break their spell by attending to differences between the superficially similar forms of expression that can lead to this type of confusion. For much of the Investigations, then, Wittgenstein tries to show how philosophers are led away from the ordinary world of language in use by misleading aspects of language itself. He does this by looking in turn at the development of various philosophical problems, from the general problem of language itself, through the notions of rules and rule following, and then on to some more specific problems in epistemology and philosophy of mind. Throughout these investigations, the style of writing is conversational with Wittgenstein in turn taking the role of the puzzled philosopher (on either or both sides of traditional philosophical debates), and that of the guide attempting to show the puzzled philosopher the way back: the “way out of the fly bottle.”  NEWLINE_TOKENMuch of the Investigations, then, consists of examples of how philosophical confusion is generated and how, by a close examination of the actual workings of everyday language, the first false steps towards philosophical puzzlement can be avoided. By avoiding these first false steps, philosophical problems themselves simp  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

Wikipedia is MORE than that, because it is not subject to the constraints that have bound traditional encyclopedias.  Size is irrelevant; I've got a half terabyte external USB drive on the Linux server across the room that is smaller and lighter than a paperback (well, Cryptonomicon at least).  Assuming good bitonal TIFF document images, that will hold 5 million scanned pages; assuming moderately compact text files (PalmOS reader format) that jumps to 250 million pages.  Printing costs are also irrelevant, since it's not printed, as are writing costs (monetary and temporal), as the labor force is both free and unbounded in size.  So it's back to first principles...NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::The definition of ``encyclopedia`` is a book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge or, less commonly, all aspects of one subject (Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)).  Since Wikipedia is unbound by the constraints of other encyclopeidas, then I truly believe that it should cover all branches of knowledge, and cover them far more thoroughly than has heretofore been possible.  As far as sysadmin topics go, Wikipedia failed me this week; if the article on Domain Name System had even so much as a link to resolv.conf, I could have save myself a lot of digging when I set up that Linux system.  In fact, I'll probably do just that, along with showing the file format of resolv.conf to that article, now that I've figured it out.  Why?  Because it's useful information that I needed and failed to find when I looked for it.  It's not quite ``narrating the process``, but it certainly is within the scope of an article on the DNS process to describe the steps taken by each part, and one of those steps would be ``the client checks the list of DNS servers (see resolv.conf etc.) to determine which name server to consult``; that's all I would have needed to find the information I needed to solve my problem.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::As Jimmy Wales said, Our goal...is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. ...empowering people everywhere to have the information they need to make good decisions.

As he well knows, this violates WP:MOS, specifically WP:ERA, which requires that any change to an article's date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with article-specific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed. As is clearly evident to everyone, none of these steps have taken place in this case.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInstead, in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queen's English and CE/BCE, Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), those comments were never enough to justify the change to CE/BCE even back then. This is of course because, as mentioned earlier, WP:ERA requires that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. Neither occured then. What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace; it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them, they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it. The ``discussion`` went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queen's English (which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE therefore didn't proceed, at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again, this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process.

I am here to try and explain something that I think you've misunderstood. The claim that I was denying peoplehood to Jews is incorrect. Those edits you've noted were, in fact, fighting a particular ANTISEMITIC person. His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting ``is a person of Jewish descent`` into articles about Jews he did not like. I was not denying Jews peoplehood, I was corecting the fallacy that Judaism is only a genetic ethnicity, which is a lie perpetrated by people like Hitler. Sposer explained it to you exactly as I would have. There are many many Jews who are not decendents of the original Hebrews. There are people who converted, people who were the product of mixed marriages in Europe, etc. They are Jews too. Concentrating on the religion aspect does not deny peoplehood, rather it eliminates the fallacy that Jews are a ``race`` only.

You'll find there lots of insights, analysis, studies, newsreports, and this will help you a lot to understand the reality of the Russian-Jewish post 90's emigration to Germany. Furthermore the german government policies, decisions and the impacto on german society have also been thouroughly  described, analysed and commentated on the main media press (Spiegel, etc) easly. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENmore Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel or feel much closer to GermanyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe reason number one for this preference is the exceptionally conditions (read money) that this german post-berlin-wall policy entitles them to.

The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI did not ignore your response; I thought my answer was clear  but I'll ride the donkey for ya. NEWLINE_TOKEN* A single section containing criticisms is an example of a poorly structured article as it means that people reading about a subject have to look in the section about it for the 'non-criticism' and then a second section to see if there is any criticism.

In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state `` Gee an F-16 in Flight `` - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article ``Aircraft is on a bomb-run`` when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::BillCJ also mentioned `` are you seriously suggesting that `` serious historians `` only read WP articles for the pictures? `` - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual`` data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.

It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying.

653360922.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your ``sky is blue`` analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that ``the Eiffel Tower is in Paris``. This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that ``Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower`` would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

I'm a bit aggravated as I provided a valid source from Canada's Walk of Fame saying that Ryan Reynolds will not be inducted on October 1, 2011 like it states in your edit. The way that you put is that we should ignore the source and just merge the columns on  the night of October 1, but according to sources, Reynolds will be unable to attend and he will be inducted at a later date, and will not be featured on the televised gala. It states that he will be inducted at a later date whether it be 2011 or 2012. (We don't know the specifics) If you merge the two columns on October 1, you are providing an untruth with regards as not all announced 2011 inductees will be inducted on the same day.  WWe should keep Ryan Reynolds seperate from the other inductees until we know for sure when he will be able to get his star.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sorry to get angry at you, but I think I am within the right to add this edit on to the page because I provided a valid source from the official commitee that says that one person's involvement has been postponed, and all that you are doing is reverting my edits, trying to sweep this fact under the carpet. As you said in your previous edit, why should it matter if the two columns will be merged in a month? Well, I thought Wikipedia was based on facts and sources, which I thought I had provided and you are selectfully omitting certain details thus allowing some inconsistencies in the article itself. You are the one that will be merging the two columns, and I don't think it would be fair and truthful to just merge Ryan Reynolds along with the other 2011 inductees into the main grid, if we still do not know when he will get inducted. That's what's getting me upset at your ways at handling the page. I did nothing wrong, just provided a valid source and I truly believe that tthere should be some sort of indication on the page at least that Ryan Reynold could not attend on October 1 due toi a scheduling conflict until we know of what will happen with Ryan Reynolds and Canada's walk of Fame.

Do not restore my revert until you find proof (not circumstantial evidence, e.g. increase in whaling activity on entirely different species coincided with the disappearance of the gray whale in the North Atlantic) that whaling was the cause of the extinction of Atlantic gray whales (good luck with that, because you won't find it).     : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: ``International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and ``Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group``. Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression ``telephone centrals`` instead of ``exchanges`` is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called ``Propaganda Wars Returns``.  `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

220195690.0,SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::I wasn't questioning the ``literary forgery`` issue i.e. ``hoax`` but the claim that ``plagiarism`` isn't used here in the lead except as a partisan view when looking at the sources of the document. Given that the document was published well after the death of the source author (whom it is alleged borrowed from an earlier source anyway) your example isn't remotely relevant. The chain of authorship isn't as simplistic as your example. An alternative presentation of plagiarism is the Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Purported_plagiarism because of the intent of the author but oddly enough the Book_of_Mormon article doesn't mention ``plagiarism`` at all. Here it is the reverse with numerous use of wording for ``plagiarism`` and in the lead paragraphs but yet with no clear idea how the (mostly) anonymous authors would gain from the plagiarism i.e. gain from the reputation of Maurice Joly. The claim of ``plagiarism`` only works if there is an unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Now the problem for you is that Serge Nilus did plagiarise the protocols but the protocols themselves are not plagiarised but derivative. If no one claims authorship then where does that leave the claim of plagiarism ? . That's not clearly proven here so I'm suggesting that the word ``plagiarism`` is removed from the lead paragraph (though it can stay within the main text and elsewhere that the protocols are used in context of being derivative from the earlier work) as it unbalances the lead. ``hoax`` and ``literary forgery`` can obviously stay.   `  : EDATA_1,test,-1,-1

459016640.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The COI tag, like most others, is a form of clean up notification. It's supposed to indicate that an article was authored by, or underwent a major edit by a conflicting party to other editors, who may then neutralise the content. It is not supposed to have full-time residence on the article once clean up has been performed and the editor/s with any COI cease to disruptively affect the neutrality of the article (which should really be brought to admin attention, not via a tag). Keeping it once the article has been made neutral is misleading and also makes Wiki articles ``ugly``. There are thousands of articles on Wiki where the original author was closely-related to the content. Once an uninvolved editor steps in and makes the tone/content neutral the tag is no longer valid. Its purpose is to serve as a warning that the content may not be neutral to other editors. Given than a lot of editors have since taken control of the matter here, and are enforcing measures to prevent Dom and those closely related to Davina from introducing puffery, peacocking and any other bollocks, there isn't really any need to ``warn`` anyone that the content may be untrue. I'm sure if or when Davina's meatpuppet ``fans`` make edits they are quickly spotted, verified and removed if unsupported. As such, I recommend removing the tag, in due course, once the minor disputes are settled. Tags are aids for editors to develop the article as fore mentioned, they should not be used in the spirit of a warning system to general readers.  [ • RFF] `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use ``facts`` based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT ``fact`` often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video.

As mentioned earlier, Forbes.com's blog post on Agostinelli isn't sourced with any data whatsoever; therefore, no one is in any position to decipher where they obtained their information. The financial journal (OGFJ) cites the $1 billion fund value in what would appear to be as reliable as one can get given the disclosure came in the context of a major financial transaction which would have implied due diligence. The Forbes.com blog source must therefore be treated accordingly and not taken as gospel or absolute. For all we know, it could be a well-orchestrated public relations bamboozling.

172104686.0,"SDATA_1 :  This assumption that German is the largest ancestry in the U.S. shows how the ancestry chart in the article is a little misleading, because most of the 20.2 million people who claim an undifferentiated ‘American’ ancestry are thought to be of English ancestry, in addition to the 24.5 million who actually specify English ancestry. Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish, most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated, roughly half of Irish Americans, or about 15 million, are thought to be Protestants, mostly from Ulster, and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent, and they still use their language. In addition, German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead. This lack of cultural affinity in descendants has had important historical consequences. It helps to explain why German-American relations have been more distant than the ethnic chart would otherwise suggest, and why German ancestry hasn't always been a big enough factor to overcome diplomatic differences.

How about this thought experiment: for continual compounding, what if the payment is not made continuously? I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:NEWLINE_TOKEN: The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.NEWLINE_TOKEN: So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.NEWLINE_TOKEN: If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).NEWLINE_TOKEN: In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).NEWLINE_TOKEN: Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point ``they`` chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.NEWLINE_TOKEN: The point being any rate/compounding period can be chosen, the calculations are just extra work often dictated by convention/regulation.

I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke. The point is just that neither of us knows whats gonna happen and we'll just have to read the story.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put ``MPT`` in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is ``Folkswagen`` but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article ``Macedonian Radio Television`` that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

128413567.0,"SDATA_1 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Cleveland Street Scandal ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJames Pope Hennessy, Queen Mary's official biographer, spoke to many people then still living who actually knew Prince Eddy (see his posthumously published book of interviews), so his statement that Eddy's private life was 'dissipated' must be taken as gospel (as too must his statements with regard to Eddy's intellectual slowness). Hennessy knew what he was writing about, and indeed, died at the hands of rough trade. His close friend James Lees Milne, who was bisexual, and with whom one can presume he would have shared the more unpublishable results of his findings, wrote the first frank biography of Lord Esher, the grey eminence of the Edwardian royal court who was pederastic, and who kept a folder of letters from parties about the scandal. Both Lees Milne, and later Theo Aronson used it for their respective books which touched on the scandal.

101271284.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, this article does not talk about a ``class of dog`` in the sense that a ``poodle`` is a class of dog. It talks about a use of certain types of dogs. To chase ``quarry``. This sets a context for these dogs (the matter of fact tone suggests approval of this use of a dog, as does, very much so, that the first requirement for a working dog is that someone should work it!). Describing what the dogs do as ``work`` is strongly biased to a positive view of it. I do not strongly object to this, although it could be rephrased into a ``voice`` that took things less for granted.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, many readers will not automatically realise that one is talking about dogs that could be used in fox hunting, yet this is primarily what they are used for at least in the UK. The article largely discusses terrier work in the UK, framing its history in terms of enclosure, which is not an issue in the States or elsewhere, because enclosure practices differed in other places. So the intro should note this, and having done so, making note in some detail why it is controversial (not just that it is) serves to balance out a piece that is far too sympathetic to one POV.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, the article on the Hunting Act is not specific on this issue, and it's appropriate to give it in some detail (if it is appropriate to go into as much detail about terrier work in the UK, which the article does).

It's not customary, and the whole point of an RS is that the facts have been reliably verified and are not simply the perspective of the source's author. If you suspect that the facts presented by Professor Rosen are only a partial picture of the situation in the 1930s, I suggest you find other reliable sources that may focus on other aspects.NEWLINE_TOKENOn a related note, while this article (like all of Wikipedia) is a work in progress, I think the situation of this section is appalling. Until I added material from Rosen, most of the section dealt with a single incident, and half of that was a description of a spat between Israel and the BBC that resulted from the incident - quite peripheral if you ask me. As I started editing the article only recently, I am hesitant to remove any material, but I think the incident should be cut to 1-2 sentences and the subsequent spat removed altogether. Obviously, more general content dshould be added, and I may do so if I have the time.   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

In particular, stealth technology had advanced to the point that high lift, high angle of attack aerodynamic shapes could co-exist with stealth requirements.

Second generation stealth as evidenced by the F-117 had yet to allow aerodynamic efficiency to co-exist with stealth.

The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with ``natural`` gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions?

As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't ``about to killed`` under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this.

Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response.

NEWLINE_TOKEN:::First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, ``meat puppet``.   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (``We don't need no stinkin' consensus!``).  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWashington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be ``little known`` outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.

So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.

497622585.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::Ok, the argument regarding the Brandenburg class is this: What distinguishes the Dreadnought type from a pre-Dreadnought? As I understand it from the article the only requirement is the uniform main battery in bore diameter and barrel length. There is a whole list what the advantages are and the only ones the Brandenburg class did not meet due to the different barrel length is maximum range (the difference is nearly irrelevant in 1890 due to fire control abilities) muzzle velocity and thus flight time and splash distinction (irrelevant because of the low number of differing guns and the missing central fire control at this time). Dreadnought labeled ships had 6 inch guns as secondary armament while the Brandenburg had only 4 inch ones as next biggest after the main guns. The maximization of striking power on long range has to be seen in the context of the time, the long range is the maximum of guns and fire control, also the power of HE does not depend on muzzle velocity but on caliber (as used in the article, which was the same for all of the 6 guns) and even the Japanese used HE 15 years later with their big guns...NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::The other advantages of the armament rest on ``caliber`` as used in the article (see ``#Main armament power and caliber``), not on barrel length, like logistical simplicity. The fire control advantage from splashes is there for only 6 guns, and if 2 shells arrive even a bit later, it is even better for distinguishing shots with the non-central firecontrol in use at this time. The rate of fire was uniform and about 2 shells per minute as stated in the Brandenburg article, no problem there as well.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::What about the rest of the design features of Dreadnought according to the article? Central fire control was not implemented in all the ``Dreadnought types`` and if it was used, then to very different degrees. The position of the main armament on the Dreadnought itself was not optimal with the wing turrets, the Brandenburg was more advanced with only centerline turrets. That there were problems like the blast damage was not uncommen, Dreadnought ships had wet guns and so on as well. The armor was undergoing heavy changes before and after the Dreadnought, the Brandenburg class had composite armour, the all-or-nothing scheme came later than Dreadnought and the armor deck (plunging fire) was thicker on Brandenburg than on the Dreadnought 15 years later. The turbine was not used by early US Dreadnoughts and coal was used on much later British ships.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::Interesting how ships not even having the same caliber (as in the article without barrel length) are mentioned as being semi-dreadnoughts and the Brandenburg class 15 years earlier only lacking the uniform barrel length but coming much closer to the ``Dreadnought description`` in many other aspects than actual early Dreadnought is totally omitted...   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   NEWLINE_TOKEN::I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the ``POWs held by the Japanese`` wikipedia article.

Also, there is one vowel (a) which is inherent and is not written unless it begins a word. Also all consonant clusters are written as ligatures, which an alphabet does not do. This script, and every other script from India, is what's called an ABUGIDA. An abugida is NOT AN ALPHABET. You don't have unwritten vowel sounds in an alphabetic system!

It would be more helpful, not to mention a show of good faith, if you would participate in the process and edit my contributions instead of completely deleting them!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that you have removed the link to the powerbasic forums, and elected to not sanction the description of ``official`` Powerbasic forum, perhaps some other relevant links would be appropriate. I agree with you that they are in fact ``user to user`` forums and will reword my contribution accordingly. I also agree with your wording ``this forum is not a source of official support.`` Additionally, Your own website states: ``Should your request goes beyond the intent of the technical support and resources we offer for free you will be advised there will be a $49 per incident charge if you would like us to proceed with your request.`` So I am not sure why you deleted that too?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I indicated, the last remnants of company support suddenly left the powerbasic forums with Lance in July 2004 as confirmed in the thread you quoted. As another member put it ``you may indeed be correct. lance's last post was july 5, 2004 and the last post that indicated he was powerbasic support was june 25... also, between march 6 and march 7 of this year lance changed his title from ``administrator`` to ``member``. if he is indeed gone i wish him a lot of luck!`` It seems pretty clear that no one at the time had any idea what happened. But this is irrelevant and I only mention it because Lance provided technical support via the forums (as can be seen by any casual search of his posts). The current levels of participation in the forum by powerbasic staff cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered support.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBecause 30 support posts of any real value in SIX MONTHS cannot be considered support, and there is no eveidence of alleged ``email support``, my statement that ``little if any real support is offered`` is valid. Support is a key issue to novice developers and should be clearly represented in the wikipedia entry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you for helping with the wording of ``there were 8508 total posts, not 8508 requests for help``. This is perhaps a more accurate statement and as I have said all along I welcome your input. Since we agree on this number, perhaps you can justify your statement of ``18,771 messages in support of PowerBASIC customers``?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe numbers I quoted are easily verifyable from your search engine. simply type in any of the historical support staff names like ``Steve Rossell`` or ``Bob Zale`` under ``User Name:``, highlight the five forums in which users confine thier posts for help:NEWLINE_TOKENPowerBasic Console CompilerNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPowerBasic for DOSNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPowerBasic for WindowsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENProgrammingNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENProgramming the Internet NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENthen hit search.

Anyone can verify these numbers. This is not my opinion.

That's all I set out to do, just wanting to hear if we could use YouTube leaks in some way to write out plot summaries to some extent. What occurred was that the other editor went into the discussion and brought up a dispute from another article. To which I replied multiple times and he removed my comments.

The medals table of Nicole Haislett looks remarkably cleaner and more graphically refined, and we may now replace many of the artificially abbreviated place names and event descriptions that were previously employed to avoid line-wrapping within the medals tables.  A couple of points remain to be discussed and resolved:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN#  how do we handle the graphics for the ``disqualified`` medal option?NEWLINE_TOKEN#  what do we do about the winner, runner-up and playoff options that were engrafted onto this template by an association football editor in 2011?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm bringing these issues here first, SFB, because you (a) are obviously not opposed to change, and (b) have a good eye for better graphics.  I would like to get on the same page with you before starting another template talk page discussion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy suggestion for the ``disqualified`` issue would be to fill square area surrounding the circular medal icon with a percentage screen of red, with a red diagonal bar drawn across the icon itself  that screams intuitive.  The disqualified option should also include a field for explanatory footnote text.  Another simpler alternative is to omit disqualified medals altogether.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for the winner, runner-up and playoffs options for association football/soccer, I seriously question whether these should be included in a ``medals`` table at all.  Having looked at several dozen footballer infoboxes that use these options, it also appears that many uses are for minor regional, national and subnational tournaments.  Frankly, I wonder if WP:FOOTY has even sanctioned many of these minor tournament outcomes for inclusion; most of them do not appear to be medal competitions, so the use of the gold, silver and bronze background colors is inaccurate.  I'm going to ping , and ask him for a football editor's perspective  WP:FOOTY is ultimately going to have make the decision or otherwise cooperate on a resolution of this.  It goes without saying that the new medal icons are graphically inconsistent with the color bar text blocks for ``Winner,`` ``Runner-up`` and ``Playoffs.``    `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAntoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIsraeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think most of what I've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time (May 2000). I've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. Maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the SLA collapse.  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

12995250.0,"SDATA_1 :   NEWLINE_TOKEN== NEWLINE_TOKEN== My first hand dissapointing experience with the movement == == NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.

Elsewhere, Prashad, an intellectual leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, has argued that the Jewish Lobby cant be powerful because to think so ``does not sit well for a Marxist framework.`` Hence Prashad has been arguing that the strength of Sharonism is what's key in US support for Israel, not the JL. Given the polemical character of Prahshad's piece and it's peripheral relationship to the actual history of the JL, and the fact that his quote is lifted out of context from what he is actually discussing/polemicizing presenting (the CPI-M line), and regardless of what one makes of his argument, this is way too weighty.   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.NEWLINE_TOKEN  noviceuserNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.NEWLINE_TOKEN  noviceuserNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUpdate: a secondary source is now available.

Besides I think it is not such a big deal that the thing about the folk tale can't be added ,even if might be true (which is unlikely). Actually believe me it's not even that much important since the main reason behind creating Ashokasundari article was to prove that there did exist a daughter of Shiva and being able to prove just that is a big achievement in itself.     : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

The fact that since the mediation they added both BOS and FLL, both *only* going to SFO *and* LAX lends more proof that LAX is a hub.

This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTrue enough regarding how political control limits the company's ``viability`` (pun intended!), however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canada's history has been fairly broad.  In the sense that any publicly owned (ie. government) company in Canada is a Crown corporation, then VIA Rail would meet that criteria.  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970's and the Canadian railway industry's deregulation in the 1980's, CN was not allowed to raise funds either.  Provincial Crown corporations like B.C. Rail and B.C. Ferries or N.B. Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence.  I could be wrong, as I have not read the VIA Rail Act in-depth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the ``money market`` in the way you describe?  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th/21st century measure this.  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nation's highways each day, or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIA/Amtrak/etc., or the environmental benefits realized, etc. etc. etc. then VIA Rail, Amtrak, Eurorail, various ferries, etc. will never be financially solvent.  Cheers,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe following section was added by  and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOfficially, the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line. However, this move was seen as somewhat more politically-motivated by some. Coincidentally, the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative. Harvey André, the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990, was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life. The CN line also went through Edmonton, the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts, however I'm unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continental's route (historically, the Super was a CN transcontinental train, and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train).  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental, they decided to keep the more-recognized Canadian brand, and use it on the CN line... why the CN line is the question, however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time, gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees, insurance costs, etc. etc.  Politics could also have played a role, or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the Trans-Canada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already well-served by inter-city busses.  The main reason I've commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark & Mulroney's ridings - Clark represented High River near Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau, Quebec.  Harvey André...  I have no idea - very likely though.  Once this part gets edited/verified properly, it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Joe Clark was born and raised in High River, but he represented Yellowhead, a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper, from 1979 to 1993. Mulroney never lived in Alberta, nor was he ever an Alberta MP.

I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as ``academically rigorous.``]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say ``article``) is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a ``denialist``; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an ``expert.`` Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not ``article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not ``article``) is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the ``so what?`` test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar? I dunno; some token of gratitude or other. •  `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

There's a difference.  ``You're an idiot,`` is an ad hominem attack.  It is a baseless insult with no constructive intention.  ``Rubbish`` is an ad hominem attack.  There is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work.  Telling fiddle they he or she has an ``arrogant obtuse attitude`` was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters.  ``Instead of posting rubbish`` is both an arrogant and insulting statement.  It did nothing to help me create a better article, OR give reasons why the SKK article was being deleted.  ``Rubbish`` is not an objective criteria.  ``This article has already been posted & debated`` is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what I posted as ``vandalism.``  My repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that I felt is important.

I literally barely had time to type a few words before the article was again deleted with absolutely zero discussion or valid justification.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI encourage ALL parties to go back and look at how this played out.  There was NO discussion other than threats & a dismissive suggestion to go play in your own sandbox.

Maybe you really have dealt with too many vandals, and were quick to lump me in with whatever hooligans you may be used to dealing with.  If I really wanted to be a vandal, I could easily use an ip proxy to keep posting & causing trouble here.  There would be little that you could do about it, but that is not who I am.  I am an honest contributor who took exception to fiddles arrogant and insulting attitude.  We can disagree on that assessment, but don't expect me to get on my knees with some ``gee, I'm sorry`` obsequiesness just so I can join the cool kids club.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy advice to you is maybe you, fiddle & hiber might reconsider your knee jerk reactions & at least assume positive intent (see ``community`` heading above) & try a discussion that does not start with something along the lines of ``your work is rubbish.``   16:42`  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Wikipedia is not a soapbox===NEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:NEWLINE_TOKEN#Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a ``sympathetic point of view`` for every article.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: ``Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.``  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small ``garage`` companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles.

This used to happen a while back; either pages for both British English and American English would exist, or more often editors would fight to move a page from one to the other. In June 2005, the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee ruled that ``when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic.`` So since an enterprising Brit got there first, American English words like millimeter and liter redirect to the British English equivalent, but the opposite is true for colour or carburettor.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In the case of geologic map, an American was the first to create the article, so you have to edit that page. However, here's a few suggestions of what you can do:NEWLINE_TOKEN:*The text in bold in the opening line should reflect the title of the article. Therefore, since geological map redirects to the page, you can change the first sentence to read ``A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show subsurface geological features.``NEWLINE_TOKEN:*If there's a difference between U.S. and U.K. maps, I'd split the two into separate sections after the opening paragraph, and detail the differences for each (re-ordering the page as I'd done with this edit). If there's no difference, I'd just remove the specific references to the United States as being unnecessary, and expand on what's there.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*You can also provide links to British geological maps if such a resource exists, as has already been done for USGS maps.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:An explanation of the style ruling can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues and Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English, or if you're really bored you can read the original case at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk, which concerned and edit war over the use of BC or BCE for Biblical dates.

What is Eastern cuisine? Western cuisine? The new wording also refers to char siu bao as a ``new ethnic food``. It is not a new ethnic food it was an existing Chinese dish that was introduced and acquired a pidgin name. The historic image of Hawaii pineapple packing, loco moco, and lomi salmon were removed.

So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system. Frank, im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book Modern Money Mechanics written in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Bank. Also, if you look at the shareholders of each Fed Bank they will all lead back to the same people, mostly located in Europe. By saying that the federal reserve bank/system  does not work for profit, yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way, and im not saying this as an insult, but the only reason of interest to be applied IS to make a PROFIT.

Among others, it quotes John Stauber to the effect that MoveOn has become ``primarily a money-raising and marketing arm of the Pelosi wing of the Democratic Party.`` It also gives what seems like a pretty balanced account of the group's origins, and of both what has remained constant about the organization and what has changed. -  |  `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

So, unless someone provides a cedible source that the RBS-15 is too large and expensive for all types of targets, the text has to be changed from it's current form, since it is highly misleading. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm gonna revert the last undo undo and add information to the text that the RBS-15 is ``just too large (and too expensive) for most types of land targets``.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== re:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. I cannot undelete the image because of WP:FUC #3.b. The image has not been reduced in size. I also believe it fails #2 in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. #8 is also jumping out at me, because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. There is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game. Therefore, the exact image you uploaded isn't appropriate for use on wikipedia, and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate, but in the proposed article would just be decorative (and against out non-free content policy). Sorry, but I hope this explanation helps.-  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Thanks very much for the reply.  I understand your Fair-Use concerns, and hopefully I can address all of them.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*FUC 3.b - Agreed.  If the image is undeleted I'd be happy to reduce it's size and upload the smaller version, but I can't really do that (download the high resolution version) until it is undeleted.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*FUC #2 - There are no commercial opportunities at stake here.  Because of the odd nature of the website, as part of an alternate reality game, the only logical copyright holder would be either Nine Inch Nails, 42 Entertainment, or Interscope records.  No one is making any money off of these websites: in fact, they officially have absolutely no connection to any company, not even to the album (Year Zero (album)) that it is parallel to.  Reznor himself has stated the ARG is NOT a promotional device.  (see Year Zero (alternate reality game) for more info on that)NEWLINE_TOKEN:*FUC #8 - Although the dates themselves are similar, the text is not.  The whole point of the originating website, Another Version of the Past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events.  The text in the WP article is a dry, point-for-point account: ``neutral`` if you will.  The two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand: pro-American, pro-government, etc and on the other hand extremist, rebellious, reformatory, etc.  The image provides the user an opportunity to see the POV/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened.  For example the New Orleans floods are described as a ``Faith-based disaster`` on one hand, and ``Why Bother with New Orleans?`` on the other.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I still believe the image wouldn't be appropriate here. The site the image came from is copyrighted, and was used to promote the album (for the record company executives), regardless what Reznor said, so FUC#2 still concerns me, and I'm not convinced of FUC#8 either. We can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. We'd need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image, IMO. I have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here, so be patient for a 2nd opinion. Thanks for your reply.-  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetings. I was asked to comment here. This image is essentially text, with decorative flourishes. As such, I don't see how  it could pass WP:NFCC#8, which requires that a non-free image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. I don't believe that the text alone, quoted, would be less informative than the image. (And I think that much text, quoted verbatim, would be a copyright violation, which is another indicator that this image isn't allowed.) All the best, –   (random) NEWLINE_TOKEN:Ok, fair enough.  I know better than to argue with two admins. =)  Thanks for taking the time to review the case.

Thanks for the info!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Butter alternatives==NEWLINE_TOKENIn response to 's request for justification on adding a section on butter alternatives, I added statements from and links to scientific studies talking about cardiovascular benefits of substituting other things for butter as well as some layman reports by health authorities which also have published on the concept of butter alternatives.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI integrated the health history into this new butter alternatives section as well. It might be the case that a ``butter alternatives`` article should be created independently and that various articles should link to it, but even in that case, I feel that it is merited to summarize publications on this topic in this article. Thoughts?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products. We should not be implying that one product needs to be replaced with another. Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::I hesitate to take your suggestion to leave the alternatives section out entirely but I would like to respond to your concerns in some way. My first thought would be that I could fork this into an article called Butter substitution, then have the list, a health discussion, and advice from organizations about doing the substitution.NEWLINE_TOKEN::About profits - there are areas on Wikipedia where there is risk of commercial intervention but I do not see unbranded food concepts as being particularly high risk at this time. I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.NEWLINE_TOKEN::How would you feel about my forking this content into its own article, putting everything there, and then keeping a statement in this article which said something like ``Many health organizations advise that consumers should use less fats in their diet and cooking and eat less butter because of the cardiovascular problems caused by the fat in many people's diets. In addition to eating less butter, these organizations recommend replacing butter with butter substitutes which are purported to have fewer adverse effects.`` I would also look for information about the health benefits of butter, if I can find any sources.

He quickly provokes me writing that my ``emmigration (certainly not as drammatic as the title ``exile`` would suggest)`` was a normal hardship.... Well, I am not going to repeat the mistakes of Giovanni Giove and answer ``tough``. I am a mature old man who has never been able to go back to where was born, who has lost all the family properties in my Cherso island, who has lived ``poorly`` (I don't know if Direktor understands fully the meaning of this word) the first thirty years of exiled life in the USA until the American Dream was realized by me and my exiled father, and who has seen destroyed by Tito the Cherso cementery were my family rested for generations (in order to make disappear another ``Italian`` evidence in my Dalmatian island). Luckily for me, I have learned from America to have faith in democracy and western justice and stay away from the hate of nationalism and racism. I am sure admin Thatcher131 understands very well that I only ask for a ``balanced`` Wikipedia, free -if possible- from nationalistic groups (Croat, Italian or whatever...). And I am sure Giovanni Giove -continuously harrassed for months/years by Kubura with his group- deserves another ``chance``. Last but not least I want to pinpoint that Direktor -in my personal opinion- is the more ``calm`` of the Kubura group, may be because has distant Italian roots. Anyway, I am not going to write again to admin Thatcher131, because I don't want to bother her.Sincerely  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1

519468109.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::Keifer, in slightly over 24 hours you have made 50 contributions. Almost all of them related to the latest Malleus farrago, and you have kept up that sort of pace for days. You've commented on numerous talk pages and reiterated yourself on numerous occasions. It is much more than merely responding, and in so far as it is responding the volume may reflect the sheer number of fronts that you are trying to cover. I mentioned ``less haste, more speed`` above, but another saying that might be apt is ``less is more``.What you do and how you do it is entirely your affair, of course, but one thing I've noticed is that Malleus seems rarely to respond directly to the many posts that you make at his own talk page. There may be some conclusions to be drawn from that. Demiurge's point regarding MONGO may have some validity, also. Certainly, both of you are going at it hammer-and-tongs and, as much as I do not like the current situation at Arbcom, it is reaching the point where I for one am tending not to bother reading many of the messages posted by you both: frankly, they've become boring and repetitive. That is the nature of propaganda, not debate.   `  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1
430025291.0,"SDATA_1 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN**So, Necrothesp, let's get this straight. You wrote an article on a woman whose crowning achievement seems to be that she ran a pottery company for something a bit over a year before World War II, with her husband, and yet you doubt the notability of a woman who has curated at least nine exhibitions over a period of 20 years at one of Australia's most important art galleries and continues to do so? Should I remind you that four years later your article only has one reference, no notes and no external links?NEWLINE_TOKEN*It's not that I dislike the disambiguation page. I'm all for it, and would certainly agree with adding a reference to a disambiguation page on this one, once the move has been made. But it seems entirely sensible to me to have a page for the only entry that's currently for someone unambiguously called Julie Robinson at the address http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Robinson and have the disambiguation page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Robinson_(disambiguation). If someone else more notable comes along with a claim to that exact address, I'd happily support her taking this page, too.  : EDATA_1",test,-1,-1
