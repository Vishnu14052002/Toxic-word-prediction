It is no different to this situation, what one can assume to be ``teenage fans`` are entering this stuff into articles and watching to ensure its not removed, when it is fancruft nonsense which is why the US/Australian magazines etc make this sort of stuff, easy money. Another major point to be made is that you don't speak Japanese and you have not read the magazine, you are referencing a website which itself hasn't done any research (but you call reliable) and is simply reposting what neojaponisme said. Interestingly this is exactly where all the information about this list comes from, and neojaponisme is not a reliable source, it is a blog site. They could of changed parts of it or made it up entirely to put in what they wanted The list itself was called biased by it's own publisher Rolling Stone (and they distanced themselves from it, even writing 独断と偏見で選んだ on the cover!!) the list is not written by someone of note, it is written by a self-published defunct fanzine owner (how amusing, a fancruft list written by a fanzine writer) You yourself can pitch an idea to a magazine and get it published, you just have to convince them it will be good for sales.

Such content could reasonably I think be added to the content in the bio of the illustrator, but from what little I know the author doesn't necessarily choose the illustrator, so there's not necessarily any real connection between the author per se and the illustrator. Having said all that, inclusion of such info in the articles on the books themselves makes perfect sense, and if it can be established that there was a degree of personal contact between an author and an illustrator, that could be referenced in the article too.

You are correct that the template in question is contra ASF, and is not something anyone would wish to see universalized by extrapolation: every WP article could merit some sort of advisory template, if one accounted for every possible precaution.  I concur also with MiraLuka, and find the wording of the template slightly paternalistic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou have requested consultation, I think, because the arguments advanced by your respected opposites appeared insufficient and/or policy-contravening.  I do believe their arguments have great strength, despite some flaws.  Examine, for a moment, your comment:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``If the primary purpose of the template is to aid/advise readers in a humanitarian fashion (as I think it is), then the template exists to serve goals that are, IMHO, wholly unencyclopedic and irrelevant to the project (the death of a few readersor even valuable contributorsand the concomitant bad press is likely to have only a de minimis deleterious effect on the project)``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom the record, I see that you registered with Wikipedia in late-December 2005; as such, you may not be familiar with the facts (and the turmoil) surrounding John Seigenthaler, Sr.  In that instance, a single false assertion (albeit a very significant one) garnered for Wikipedia enormous negative press attention, and caused many observers to question the viability and basic premises of the project  a great boon for the Britannica boosters.  The lessons of that episode are numerous, but those applicable here include: 1) The smallest misplaced line of text is a potential danger; 2) Liability for a project in the public eye exists not simply in the law, but even moreso in the press.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is a sad commentary on the state of the American public that I can easily imagine many readers relying solely on Wikipedia without thinking for themselves.  In most contexts, caveat lector; let them be undone by their ignorance.  In highly visible situations, however, where the press is likely to overextend itself in finding and pillorying any ``villian,`` no matter how remote the causation, or how unjustified the charge, Wikipedia must take care.  This is an encyclopedia first, but also a non-profit foundation existing on donations.  As editors, we have a duty to protect the reputation of the project.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis raises a second point.  There is a rhetorical error in your comment cited above that has little to do with logic, except perhaps the logic of human psychology.  Large groups are rarely coldly analytical, a fact I find unfortunate quite often.  Nevertheless, it is a fact to which a wise persuader should adapt. ``The death of a few readers...is...a de minimis deleterious effect...``  This sentence is likely to win one more opposition than support, even if it be logical and empirically correct.  Those who think first from emotion might well react to such sentiment with alarm.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the precedent of Seigenthaler, I understand why your opposition is showing extraordinary caution when confronting the spectre of a possible high-visibility ``press event,`` ie. natural disaster.  Given your rhetorical misstep, I understand also why you might fail in this argument, even if the opposition were meritless (thankfully, they are not so.)  On balance, you are probably more correct; the case is not unambiguous, though.  Policies and guidelines exist as principles to be applied by the responsible community in its decision-making fora.  Very rarely, an underdeveloped discussion will ignore these principles, in which case, review (and chastisement) are warranted.  More typically, well-meaning editors apply principles as best they can to cases where principles conflict or overlap.  This case is an example of the latter, and you should waste no worry over the result. Best wishes,  `  : EDATA_1",dev,0

India WAS a spiritual country, where different cultures co-existed and confluenced across South Asia. But that was long before colonization, that threw up new nations on ethnic and religious basis.

Historical-critical biblical theologians have no automatic nor exclusive claim to authority in this matter. Neutrality in this instance is clear. The article must provide context to the reader about the question, show the various positions and approaches taken in different fields, and ensure that no single claim to exclusive authority or evocation of essentially meaningless and conflictual universal generalisations is present. It can not possibly be any clearer. The article is fundamentally flawed in two ways 1)claims to exclusive authority and 2) circular and self-referential evidentiary support. If we welcome a diversity of perspectives, educate the reader, and all show more respect and dignity to each other we will surely end up with one heck of a great article. What do you think?

And I have an interest in seeing IP editors treated well, by the majority of us, not the few.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluating its sources.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe goals in doing this are three:NEWLINE_TOKEN*(1) To allow us to come to consensus as to the quality of the article, at least in terms of verifiable information (though for this scientist, and for purists such as myself and NeilN, it is likely that if sources should come out, content must also);NEWLINE_TOKEN*(2) To identify patterns of problems, so particular individuals with time and desire might address them (e.g., incomplete therefore unverifiable entries, poor specific sources for particular blocks of information, varyingly formatted similar sources and repeat sources making source followup difficult, etc.), and NEWLINE_TOKEN*(3) To create a list of first issues to address, so that there might be a common set of priorities (i.e., where the list below might, in months to come, be sprinkled with  markers).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn doing this, I am applying the same academic standards as I might have in reviewing a paper submission from a sixth form or older student, on into university.

You seem to be assuming rational behaviour on the part of consumers, whereas we often buy goods and services on the basis of irrational choices (cigarette, anyone?). The result of this is inelastic demand for goods and services to which people have some sort of emotional attachment or addiction - that is, if gas prices go up by 1000%, consumption may only drop 10%.

563290905.0,"SDATA_1 :  `==My complaint about the WMF==NEWLINE_TOKENWhen assessing WMF's policies, one need not resort to vicious name-calling or opprobrious epithets. One need only present the facts. Let's start with my claim that WMF insists that it can bring about peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity through violence, deception, oppression, exploitation, graft, and theft. Sorry, WMF, but, with apologies to Gershwin, ``it ain't necessarily so.`` Gloomy philodoxes like WMF are not born—they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, if WMF's patsies had even an ounce of integrity they would urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that a real fight against vagarious, gin-swilling Comstockism can be undertaken only if a basic change in social conditions makes it possible to set the stage so that my next letter will begin from a new and much higher level of influence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENForgive me for boring you with all the gory details, but I must ask that WMF's torchbearers change the world for the better. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire. All the deals WMF makes are strictly one-way. WMF gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. WMF's belief is that it should be free to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as ``improvident, rambunctious know-nothings`` in order to justify operations against them. Hey, WMF! Satan just called; he wants his worldview back.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've tried to explain to WMF's snarky pals that WMF is incapable of looking with an open mind at anything that doesn't strictly endorse its views. As could be expected, they were a bit slow on the uptake. I just couldn't get them to comprehend that I can say one thing about WMF. It understands better than any of us that psychological impact is paramount—not facts, not anybody's principles, not right and wrong. I'm not suggesting that we behave likewise. I'm suggesting only that WMF is unquestionably proud of itself for conconcting such a ``brilliant`` scheme for harming others or even instilling the fear of harm. In my opinion, however, that's the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Much better would be to give the needy a helping hand as opposed to an elbow in the face. That's the end of this letter. If I was unable to convince you that I am making an appeal to the intelligence of the reader not to be fooled by WMF's demagoguery, then you should definitely consider contacting me with your supporting or refuting evidence, opinions, personal stories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next letter.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  micro.dot.cotton `  : EDATA_1",dev,0

What's up with theseNEWLINE_TOKEN. Ive ask the WP:RD, it's all  who is dowloading me those informations. I don't expect any sunlight to go to Uranus and Neptune, so the best term to say the sky is black. How you know Uranus and neptune is not that pitch-black-dark. On Mars I was learnt to not notice the orange color. I've ask the WP:RD, it's what SteveBaker said. I beleive and let's hope SB is doing a good job giving me accurate informations.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Greetings.  As I indicated in the edit summaries, some of your statements are totally incorrect; this casts doubt on the accuracy of your edits generally.  In several places you removed clear existing text and replaced it with confusing, even incoherent or unrelated statements.  Sub-standard English is a large part of the problem.  It might be best if you had someone check your grammar and spelling prior to editing articles, rather than work on Wikipedia alone.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Please keep in mind that substantial changes should be sourced, regardless of who is giving you information.  Be careful not to add (or substitute) information that represents original research.  Also, you might want to read WP:FIVE as a basic introduction to Wikipedia policies.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHow you explain  and . You said my information I add to Uranus and Neptune is not right. The sunlight on Uranus and Neptune is like 50 to 100 feet away from candle, 400 and 900 times dimmer sunlight. O my god, that's alot . It's like total blackness a dark swirling mass is below my feet in orbit. That's like a candle light halfway down my high school campus. I hadn't found any information about uranus and Neptune's total blackness  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I do not think you have read what I wrote above, or studied the policy pages I linked to.  If you intend to edit Wikipedia articles, be prepared to provide reliable sourcing, not information from the reference desk, or your own interpretations.  It is clear you are learning the fundamentals of astronomy for the first time.  I question whether you are ready to contribute constructively to a sophisticated scientific article at this time.  If you insist upon doing so, and go on in the same manner as before, your edits are almost certain to be reverted as unsourced original research or unclearly expressed.  I would advise you instead to postpone editing for now and learn as much as you can about the science, and also to concentrate on improving your command of English.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen how you know Jupiter's sunlight is 27 times fainter? That's what you fix by, then would that mean Jupiter is 27 times dimmer? Less sunlight, thne the planet is dimmer. Then reflect sunlight just like our rocky planets, they don't make their own light. Same thing as why nighttime on earth is always black, our ground is always black at night. You said the statement suppose to be source, then how you got those informations from?  NEWLINE_TOKEN:It simply comes from the inverse square law.  The mean distance of Jupiter from the sun is  approx. 5.2 astronomical units, whose square is 27; a bit more accurate than 25 (based on 5 A.U.) Bear in mind that that is incident light.

I have been a Muslim for five years and know perfectly the hatred that Muslims have for apostates and the level of intolerance towards their critics. Been there, done that myself, without even being aware of it. It all seemed normal to do. Today I find myself on the other side of the fence. Quoting opinions contrary to those believed by Muslims is not hate speech. The Quran is filled with hate speech. Look at the article Ali Sina for example: that is hate speech. The very language is despiteful. My every contribution to Islamofascims, Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed. The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed. We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda. Both views must be expressed equally. Take the example of Sina’s page. There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar, a rabid anti Islamist, Islamophobe, etc. In the paragraph that said “Ali Sina is a controversial personality” I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sina’s fans from those of his foes.  This is not to agree with those opinions. Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail, with all inane and invalid excuses. I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important. They are just a sample of what people say about him. It goes from one extreme to another. I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples. Why Muslims do not want to have any mention of what Sina’s fans say about him and only the insults of his foes are mentioned? Any fool will see this article is written by people with an axe to grind against it subject.

Second, if the first does not apply, does it feature a major appearance by characters or settings strongly associated with the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts does, since about half of the major NPCs are from the series. Ehrgeiz does, since it has several playable characters (one of whom is actually on the cover of the game) from Final Fantasy VII. Secret of Evermore might, as well: I was under the impression that the appearances were more along the lines of brief cameos that integral roles, but if someone wants to argue otherwise, I'm listening.

397994318.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Nothing personal Radh, I appreciate the input. My rant is directed at Toa mostly. I realize, Tao, you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical. You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty, meaningless claims. How about this for a rule: 1) before you comment on other people, read what they say; 2) before you comment on the page, read the page. You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments. While I believe Radh is well intentioned, he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page (please see the ``writers`` section, what used to be the lead section which Doom, who has been working ont his page for a very long time, moved lower  both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time; both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page; the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned, practical, and based on knowledge of the page, none of which applies to your comments, Tao). Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others; they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. Radh suggests it and it's an excellent and practical solution. It makes no sense to me. I can't help thinking you have tourettes or something, finger tourettes, that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas.  Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, ``beat generation`` means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle. I'm not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. I'm suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an ``excellent and practical solution`` because it's not an actual change  which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. Here, I'll make it easy for you Tao: Beat Generation.  It's just right there.  One click away. Take ten minutes, take an hour, whatever. Being an effective smartass means being a well informed smartass.  `  : EDATA_1",dev,0

As for the fact government employees were given the day off, it should be included, but the way in which it was included was not neutrally phrased. As for source 17, according to WP policies blogs belonging to major newspapers can be used as source, however since the writer of this blog is clearly extremely biased, his biased views should not be put in that way, into the article. Now my problem is nto with the reliability of the LA-Times, but with the fact that this man was completely baselessly labelled as a plainclothed policeman, while there is no proof of that at all. The blogger claims this because of seeing an amateur video, but how do any of us know he is an undercover policeman? He could be an angry government supporter, he could be a terrorist, he could be a random gunman, he could be an agent of the CIA or even the Iranain Green Movement itself, sent to open fire for propaganda reasons.

86954611.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYeah, it's pretty fascinating. I disagree that New Englanders moved into New York City and changed the accent to non-rhotic. Lots of people moved into New York City...Jews, Italians, and Irish being the biggest. I think New Englanders might be around # 178 on the list of groups moving to NYC, and the New Engand -ar is so different from the NYC -ar that we can forget the whole theory. Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like Syracuse or Albany did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around Syracuse is the same as that in the city. People move back and forth all the time. You have to have a big city like NYC or Boston to have enough isolation to create a new accent. There is no variation in accent anywhere from eastern NY to Syracuse, city, rural, or whatever, because people move around too much and there is no isolation. The first change going west happens in Rochester, where o changes to a. So, ``doctor`` becomes ``dactor,`` ``contact`` lenses becomes ``cantact`` lenses. I'm an optometrist, a dactor who fits cantacts whenever I'm in Rachester. Ha ha. I tell patients to turn their hat around and they turn their head around. e becomes a, so ``head`` sounds like ``hat.`` I ask them, how do you say ``head`` and they say ``heead.`` Buffalo gets worse, it has a Midwest accent, by everybody's opinion, and many Buffalo people think it's part of the Midwest.

326911256.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== FAGS ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.

Hence the Dominions declared war independently of Britain in 1939 (and the Irish Free State, which was a Dominion at the time, remained neutral). Britain is not even a ``first among equals``. That is the difference between the Commonwealth of Nations and the British Empire. In fact, for most of the war, the vast majority of Australian forces served under Douglas MacArthur in the South West Pacific Area, rather than under British commanders anywhere else. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Similarly it is a misrepresentation to say that the United States ``ran`` the Kuomintang.

As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher.

Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.

I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers.

As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word ``official``, since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the ``official scientific body``, because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for ``unofficial cultural definitions``, such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put ``Definition`` and ``Disagreement`` under the main heading of ``Etymology``.  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::I deliberately changed the se  : EDATA_1",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page.

The argument of Yellow Up that ``This is just one of thousands of trials against military evaders`` which was rpeated by Danntm ``just a simple, unimportant court-martial`` is factually not true. It is very exceptional for the IDF to grant a political objector a full court martial where he can be defended by a lawyer and call witnesses (and make political speeches). It does not happen more often than once in a decade. The usual procedure is ``disciplinary proceedings`` where you are judged by a commaning officer in his bureau, with no lawyer or witnesses, and it lasts about five minutes - but the officer can only give a maximum of 28 days, unlike the full court martial which can give years. But the descision to have a full court martial is far from routine, it is taken on the highest levels. Then there is the fact that the act which the trial was about - a soldier writing ``subversive`` graffiti of 117 tanks and other military vehicles - is far from routine, it is certainly unique in Israel and I think quite exeptional for armies worldwide. And finally, Majorly jusitifed the decision to delete by stating ``The vast majority were delete comments, and there seemed to be consensus to delete`` . Now, I took a look at the deletion log of article submitted on January 8 together with mine . As far as I could see, virtually all of those which were fianlly deleted had a real ovewhelming majoroity in favor, many of them complete unanimity.

Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   NEWLINE_TOKEN:The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.     NEWLINE_TOKEN::Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds  : EDATA_1",dev,0

I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as ``vandalism,`` but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them ``unreferenced crap`` or ``vandal`` and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his ``massive increase`` and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called ``crap`` information like ``Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique`` when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like ``scientist Gero`` added to the unclear information that simply said ``Red Ribbon`` at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority.

Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with ``Delete`` endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.

I actually created the early life section. There wasn't any info on it. When I first read his page.  Quit being ridiculous and leave the silly info on the page. If your a liberal who hates West, that's fine, you're not the only one but if you think deleted family facts from his Wikipedia page is going to ``bring him down``, then LOL. You must be off your rocker. Most people already know what I listed anyway because he mentions at it seems quite frequently. Except maybe the fact his mom was a civilian marine employee.

It only becomes an actual world war in 1941. It could be rationally argued that if the war had ended before 1941, before the USA and SU got involved, then it would just have been called the European War, or the Great Nazi War, or the Anglo-Franco-German War or something similar. It is difficult to see why a war which leaves out the two most powerful countries on Earth could in any real sense be called a ``world`` war. (And I am writing this as a European.)

A province really does not have a monetary policy (though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash) and the phrase was too general to begin with, so that's gone. I changed ``did nothing to stop`` to ``did not work to stop``, though your criticism is valid. Note however that, when De la Rúa took office, Argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it, and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. Then came the corralito, etc. On the whole, the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them. I don't remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. Note also that ``economic collapse`` doesn't refer only to the critical period November 2001 - February 2002, but to the whole recessive period (1999-2002) and some time before and after. We should agree on a phrase that links De la Rúa's measures with the crisis without falling into any of:NEWLINE_TOKEN:#``... did not work to stop the economic collapse.``NEWLINE_TOKEN:#``... ended up precipitating the economic collapse.``NEWLINE_TOKEN:#``... ultimately caused the economic collapse.``NEWLINE_TOKEN:#``... were intended to cause the economic collapse.`` (!!)NEWLINE_TOKEN:#``... had nothing to do with the economic collapse`` (!!!)NEWLINE_TOKEN:Then the ``import-dependent`` thing. Consider this: right after the devaluation, neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. The public hospital where I worked initially could not get X-ray film from the providers, and then only by paying in cash (and in dollars). Argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. I'd say that's rather import-dependent, though we may be speaking of different things. What do you propose?NEWLINE_TOKEN:What's the problem with the religious aspects of the Supreme Justices? The previous justices were all old, male, and ideologically conservative, and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the Catholic Church. And now two of them are women, one is the president of the Court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. The clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the Supreme Court were really important. Argibay's atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. In a country where the Church attacks anyone who dares speak of women's rights, having these two women at the top of one of the country's government branches is extremely significant.NEWLINE_TOKEN:The qualification ``historical`` for the payment to the IMF is that (correct me if I'm wrong) Argentina had never decided to pay so much to the IMF or anyone else, not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule; and this payment has re-defined the relationship of Argentina with the IMF and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm glad we're discussing this here civilly.

There are a lot of people who love that country, within and beyond, and yet are as deeply distressed by its military and political history as they are of their own.

NEWLINE_TOKEN::You're right in logical terms, since it has analogies with the terms with which you compared it. But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country ('Anglo'/'Franco'/'Sino'/'Russo'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts. There's an informal rule that ethnic disyllable are neutral, a pejorative connotations elicit monosyllables ('spik, wog, yid, chink, gook, hun','nip'/'jap', 'frog' etc., though exceptions exist, 'Polack') and this plays round the other terms, to nuance them in various ways. Language is a minefield, and what to one ear sounds okay, to others may resonate differently.NEWLINE_TOKEN::To illustrate on a different level, Wiki as I said is full of incoherencies over pages, and hidden traps, and most efforts, as the present one on 'Judea and Samaria' to get clarity and conceptual coherence into the encyclopedia fail because most people are tone-deaf to these things. One I noted long ago was that in articles like that on Avraham Stern,Lehi, orGush Enumin you'll often note native Israeli editors insisting on the word 'underground' to describe them, these ultra-Zionist terrorist movements, and, I don't think this word is used of comparable Arab movements i  : EDATA_1",dev,0

Classifying a particular vehicle as ``luxury`` is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial.

Here's about the mechanism of this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``This is a commonplace in Chechnya. I have not been to Nalchik and I do not know this case, but it is quite possible that such things happen there too. Well, basically, they happen throughout entire Russia, only specifics are different — drugs or weapons are planted in order to jail one or get paid for closing a case,`` an officer of the Department for the Combating of Organised Crime and Terrorism of the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry told Caucasian Knot's correspondent. ``Of course, civilians sometimes die in Chechnya and in other North Caucasus republics, too, where counter-terrorist activities are conducted, and weapons are planted on them by officers that are not the most conscientious. But one should understand that they do so not because they want to register another victory for themselves, but for fear that they can be jailed for good because of this accidental killing.`` According to the officer, one should not say that ``someone is killed on purpose and then registered as a rebel. Only Kadyrovtsy do so. It is not a custom among us, federals.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd actually indeed some time later a group of Kadyrov's policemen (called ``a gang``) were persecuted precisely for this, that is killing random people (few men and a woman they kidnapped and killed) and then planting guns and explosives on them for promotions.

Minestra is Italian for soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.  It could be translated as ``big soup,`` but that is perhaps too literal.  In any case, saying that it means ``big soup`` does not aid understanding, but rather confuses.  Why is it big?  Is it made in large quantities?  Are the vegetables big?  And so on.  It is sufficient to say that minestra means soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Under Etymology, I made changes to improve conciseness.  It is not necessary to cite every etymologically related word (i.e., ``minister`` and ``minus``); in fact, doing so clearly caused confusion since an editor in the History section of this article refers the reader to the Etymology section for the 14th c. appearance of minestrone.  Quite apart from being OR (that's another copy-edit) it is incorrect; the 14th c. is when the verb ``to minister`` appeared in English.  It has nothing whatever to do with vegetable soup except for deriving ultimately from the same Latin root.   `  : EDATA_1",dev,0

Goddamit!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Discussion of New Jacque Fresco Article ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe new article is up. There may be some contentious information in it. I realize the ``Reception`` section may be most controversial. Some may recognize that there are events and issues missing from the article. This is because some popular claims have not been verified yet or cross-confirmed. On the other hand, there may be some things that are superfluous. Discuss suggestions here. Good luck editing it; it's an intricate string of text.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Good job! I do have some concerns with some of the sources, though. ``The Soveriegn Independent`` is hardly a reliable source, but just one these infinite slanted political outlets claiming to be ``alternative news``. Russia Today is notoriously unreliable as well with load of nonsense news about aliens making it look more like Weekly World News that a source of information.  In addition the Florida Living Magazine article is basically an interview with Fresco, and therefore the source is Fresco himself, and as such it may break WP:BLPSPS. That goes for Jack Roberts Miami news article as well, but at least it's used much less as a source. And that article works fine as a source for him being called a dreamer, though. ) And why did you add Frescos claim of making a car with only 32 moving parts, not not his claim of inventing a 3D TV with picture so real you could feel you could touch it? ;-)   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I considered whether some of the news articles will be reliable beings they use Fresco's word as their source. But in many instances, the citation is doubled up and the claim/information is cross referenced between those two sources. But if some is unacceptable then we will have to make adjustments.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Maybe it can be rescued if we point out that it's his claims and we say that he *claimed* to develop a car with only 32 moving parts. We have no source for this except two interviews with him, one which he also seems to claim to have invented 3D TV, that articles' reliability is maybe not as high as we want it to be. But I suspect that in biographies we shouldn't have personal claims even if we mar them as such, but somebody with more BLP experience than me should make that call.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are some parts of the article regarding the theory of The Venus Project that I disagree with, but on the whole it seems to be an outstanding piece of work.

4425527.0,"SDATA_1 :  `Today I made a change to some of the wording in this section, based on the notion that a ``right`` is inherent/inalienable and is thus not something which can be conferred, rather only acknowledged and protected, at least when talking about law, social contracts and a political candidate's position in regard to such matters. In particular, phrases like ``Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals`` (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition.

After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of ``Semitic``. Those dialects became known as ``Languages`` after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab.

144795615.0,"SDATA_1 :   (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007  : EDATA_1",dev,0

I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Let me explain what I mean with my ``intuitiveness`` concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply ``antigravity`` to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's ``beating`` some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to ``beat`` as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (``then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right...``) and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  `  : EDATA_1",dev,0

According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as ``anti-Soviet elements`` among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (``Yezhov storm``).

San and Ashitaka part, vowing to see each other as much as possible, while Ashitaka, finally freed of his curse, decides to rebuild Tataraba. Eboshi vows to rebuild Tataraba along more harmonious lines,...`` - what I see there it's completely muddle, misinterpret, lie. This is rough OR and distortion of what we really see in the film. I hope you will understand. And much places in your sand-box version like this example. So I disagree, must decline your version. Reread please what I wrote to Elen about different variants (point two).

It talks about repetition, and a threatened ``retaliation`` the Predictor, but it describes an equilibrium which doesn't need retaliation or a repeated game at all.  The equilibrium {choose both boxes, predict both boxes} is quite stable for the single-round game, and is the only Nash equilibrium.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBoth players choosing ``one box`` is also a Nash equilibrium for the repeated game.  However, when we have a repeated game, another Nash equilibrium is possible.  If the Predictor adopts a strategy ``always choose one box unless the Chooser chose two boxes last round`` then the Chooser can also always choose one box and have no incentive to deviate.  Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.  Hence, the deviation is discouraged and the equilibrium is stable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe real question is, is any of this germane to the article's topic?

Introduction should be a summary of the entire article, and generally should not contain information which is not contained within the body. One of the images contains a watermark for a website. NEWLINE_TOKEN#Citation of reliable sources where necessary: Large areas of uncited information. Orphan sentences only complicate the issue of finding what comes from which source. Article is littered with tags and rough edits.NEWLINE_TOKEN# No original research: Uncited information may contain original research.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince that time, the introduction has been expanded, the offending watermark has been cropped out of the image (which had been donated under the appropriate licence by the site in question), and citations have been added, though maybe not enough.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe peer reviewer tool came up with the following concerns:NEWLINE_TOKEN#Consider adding more links to the article; per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links) and Wikipedia:Build the web, create links to relevant articles.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Per Wikipedia:What is a featured article?, Images should have concise captions.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers), there should be a non-breaking space -   between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of 45 cubic inch, use 45 cubic inch, which when you are editing the page, should look like: 45 cubic inch.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally do not start with articles ('the', 'a(n)'). For example, if there was a section called ==The Biography==, it should be changed to ==Biography==.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was Ferdinand Magellan, instead of using the heading ==Magellan's journey==, use ==Journey==.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), avoid using special characters (ex: &+{}[]) in headings.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Per WP:WIAFA, this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long – consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per Wikipedia:Summary style.NEWLINE_TOKEN#The script has spotted the following contractions: Didn't, if these are outside of quotations, they should be expanded. (A search of the article found the use of ``didn't`` in a quote of a reference.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe should also keep an eye on WP:SIZERULE, which indicates that we should probably split this article.

Thanks for pointing out that Waenre was actually part of Akhenaten's titulary. Gabolde certainly knew this but I did not. I thought it was another epithet like Meryamun.

This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.).

What has been on the news this last month has been that sectors of the commuter network (the suburban train network) are being closed to convert them to the high speed network which will connect to guadalajara, im actually a bit confused and frustrated about this myself. And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins /     : EDATA_1",dev,0

So, I ask 28bytes to not resign as an arbitrator.

The track ``Wet T-Shirt Nite`` was changed to ``Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt``, ``Toad-O Line`` was changed to ``On The Bus``, and the Central Scrutinizer's dialogue from the end of ``Lucille has Messed My Mind Up`` was separated into its own track, entitled ``Scrutinizer Postlude.`` I don't know about the remastered vinyl box set that came out the same year, but I assume it had the original names. The only thing close to an explanation I've ever heard for any of these changes is the ``Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt`` change.

The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENe. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThink about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due   : EDATA_1",dev,0

(Again, the fact that the Proto-Caucasian and Proto-Sino-Tibetan reconstructions used are difficult to test is in the article – you're welcome to move it to a more prominent position.) Sure, Trask has, mainly because his reconstruction of Pre-Basque is different. (I will mention this more prominently in the article.) But besides?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere is a post by Stefan Georg on when a hypothesis on language relationships should be considered accepted. For the record, Georg is currently most famous for fighting against the Altaic hypothesis (though he accepts a Tungusic-Korean-Japonic grouping as likely), rejects Nostratic, rejects DC, but accepts Seefloth's Uralo-Siberian because it's based on morphology. Here is a follow-up by Trask, here one by Vovin, and here another one by Georg.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo be an Indo-Europeanist, you have to know a lot about each of the branches of IE. How many people, other than the late Starostin, have anything near that kind of knowledge about East Caucasian and West Caucasian and Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan and so on? Bengtson seems to be working on it, but he almost completely limits himself to Basque, the two Caucasians, and Burushaski (which he finds to be closely related), but he almost never mentions Sino-Tibetan or Na-Dené. That makes about one half of a person that is capable of judging the DC hypothesis (as a whole) beyond finding mistakes in the data from one of the supposed members. For that matter, Starostin himself largely ignored Na-Dené, Basque, and Burushaski.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs there (already) a paper that takes the proposed evidence apart? If so, I'll be glad to cite it. (For the record, here is a discussion of a paper that shows, IMHO quite clearly, that what little evidence there was for including Omotic in Afro-Asiatic was wrong. A link to that paper is included.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere, incidentally, is an introduction to Burushaski – secondary literature – which makes favorable comparisons to Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn sum, I don't see anything wrong with presenting the hypothesis (in its latest incarnation) on Wikipedia. It is a controversial discussion subject, so (comparatively) many people will find it interesting.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the meantime, I'll add some morphological evidence (suppletive pronoun paradigms, noun class prefixes) to the Macro-Caucasian section of the article, provided that Bengtson tells me that this paper is actually published.

Now get back to looking at Raw guest hosts and other childish wrestling topics. You make me sick - a grown man devoting his life to watching basted men in pants pretending to scrap. Did you enjoy watching Randy Orton's glistening belly button and atomic wedgie last week?

156210467.0,"SDATA_1 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe question of head winds. Both the last forecast sent to Earhart and Noonan and their reported conditions agree. It is most likely that they were encountering headwinds as high as 23 knots. It is also certain from her reports that they had climbed considerably above the optimum altitudes early in the flight and thus had to have had considerable additional fuel consumption. I would  refer you to Kelly Johnson's instructions prepared for Earhart on the flight profile necessary to achieve optimum range. Given the variables which we cannot know, I would imagine that she had 1-2 hours reserve by the time she reached the vicinity of Howland - but that might be optimistic. I cannot know how much fuel she had. One radio log indicates she stated 1/2 hour (but did that include the remainder of 100 octane?). One thing for certain is that she did state she was ``low on fuel`` and that cannot be reasonably interpreted as meaning she was ``fat.`` This is OPINION, but given the anxiety she seemed to have in her voice and her use of the term 'low on fuel,`` coupled with the forecast and reported (by her) winds, it is probable that they were far less than the optimum 4-5 hours given still air and best altitude operations would have made possible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMr. Gillespie can dismiss her report of ground speed and winds aloft as well as the far higher than optimum altitude she reported less than half way into the flight with the term ``speculation`` (in a foot note). No one did at the time, nor can I. (OPINION- but) Though this is my Opinion, I CAN document several aspects of it including  the airplane designers instructions and how his instructions for an optimum profile differed from her report. Her reports and how they coincided with the last forecast the USN sent her from Hawaii. And thus how if Kelly Johnson was right, True had not incompetently read the information about winds aloft from reporting stations near her path, and she was not lying; then she MUST have had significantly higher fuel consumption than the optimum profile would have produced. How much, that is a question I cannot specifically answer. But for all three to be totally wrong, for there have been still air, for True to have been incompetent in his interpretation of winds aloft reports, and Earhart to have been lying about the ``winds`` she reported and her ``speed`` takes a bit of ``speculation`` I cannot indulge in. Mistakes were made, but I can't imagine everyone made exactly the right combination of mistakes and deceptions to allow the Electra to have achieved it's optimum performance on the flight. Given the time which they apparently (from reports and signal strength) spent searching  for Howland Island, it is unlikely that they had a big reserve when the last signal was heard (OPINION). `  : EDATA_1",dev,0

That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be ``an editor of astrotheology`` and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom.

John as Ceann Comhairle does not vote except in ties or have much to do except he is the speaker and his job is to keep control, and see to it that rules are adhered to. John has a casting vote in the event that there should ever be a tie in voting in the Dail, as nearly happened last week during a vote on Aer Lingus in Shannon which the gov won only by one vote, should that or any other vote be a tie John would have to cast his deciding vote which would most likely favour Fianna Fail. John will in theory remain a TD until 2017 providing he lives that long and that this current gov and the next government of 2012 goes full term. It was a stroke of genius by Bertie to nominate John as Ceann Comhairle as it will guarantee him his seat in the hotly contested South Kerry constituency which may merge with Kerry North to form a five seater representing all County Kerry. John is guaranteed his seat and it may eventually rid Fianna Fáil of the Healy-Rae Dynasty as Jackie (Highly Unlikey) or his son Michael would then be under pressure to retain the Healy-Rae seat in face of massive pressure from either Tom Fleming (unlikely) or Mark Daly (most likely) in a five seater the Healy Rae's would gather votes in North Kerry but either way they would be under pressure.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== CAT:CSD hint removal ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI completly disagree with this statement.  It is like saying that this is a job that the admins have to do. It is not.  Having the admins do the patroling reduces the time that they have for other admin activities.  Some editors are already complaining that the admins are not doing editing since they are only doing admin work.  Having all editors do the screening takes a large amount of work away from the admins and allows them to spend more time on admin activities like doing deletes.  Patroling takes more time then reviewing the nominations and deleting those that need deleting, or moving to prod or moving to AfD or cleaning up or just pulling the tag.  Statements that make it sound like admins have to do this are not helpful in my opinion.  We should be pushing to have users do as much as they can and that's doing the patroling.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:One other point that you may be missing.  I do ocassionally patrol new pages.  In almost every case, I do not do a delete but add a speedy tag since I believe that I should not make a decision on my own.  Yes, there will always be a few cases where the decision is obvious.  But I believe that having someone else confirm my opinion is the right way to go.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Yea, I could be more bold.  I know that my deletes are not approved by everyone given the trashing of my user and discussion page, saved by the bots!.  Maybe at some point I will be bolder.  I also skip quite a few and have also been accused of being too quick to pull the trigger.  I have come to the conclusion that there is no perfect balance.  No matter what you do, you will piss off someone.  In any case, I still try to do some editing.  If I was scanning the new pages I would not have time to do much else.  Part of the burnout problem is there is too much to do.

I have repeatedly requested Montalban to recognise this fact and to take measures to address it that would retain the arguments while improving the reading experience. It is for that reason that I have refrained from comment in this article for a long time now in the hope that this holy peace would bear fruit. I have been disappointed in this hope. With the creation of the other article, the imperative to have all the material in this particular article became less obvious.

346884008.0,"SDATA_1 :  `==Kolyma==NEWLINE_TOKENI came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.NEWLINE_TOKENThere has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.NEWLINE_TOKENI found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.NEWLINE_TOKENI look forward to hearing from interested parties.NEWLINE_TOKEN: Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:NEWLINE_TOKEN:* Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)NEWLINE_TOKEN:* Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it's probably ok now, too.NEWLINE_TOKEN:* Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.NEWLINE_TOKEN:* Drawing most of the information from Solzh's Gulag and dissidents' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page's discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is ``evil``, as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. NEWLINE_TOKEN:* Furthermore, Solzh's book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70's and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.

Even though 173.63.176.93 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1's sockpuppet, he was let off with a warning. For the full story, I suggest that you check out Thmc1's most recent investigation, August 2012. The final assessment was one account (Nyc88) permanently blocked, one IP temporarily blocked, and one left open with warning. If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation.

Assuming good faith, I've went with the former, but if you still insist that it's the latter, I'll take your word for it. Either way, it's becoming disruptive and incivil and needs to end.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::As for your question, if you were indeed as up to speed on our guidelines and policies as you'd like everyone here to believe, then you'd know that WP:NOR#Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources secondary sources are preferred over primary sources. We have three secondary sources that support the existing content, and one primary (and very partisan) source. ``He also rejects the prevailing view of the scientific community that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the sole cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).`` accurately summarizes the three secondary sources, while your version, ``He also proposed a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against the hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS.`` merely repeats the rhetoric of the partisan primary source, in effect giving that fringe viewpoint undue weight.
