Fewer than 200 remain and six of them are in Broome County!

Similarly, WP:NOTLINK doesn't apply here since there is a lot more meaningful data attached to the entries in the list.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a side note, I think it would be most helpful to this article to either create articles for each of the entries on here, or at least give some references as to why they're notable. I personally don't see the Alexa criterion as making it notable, and instead I'd just fall on WP:WEB as a way of determining notability. —   `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by ``mainstream`` academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the ``mainstream`` view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different.

I'd argue that the 59 references used to write the Mary Miller (actress) implies a much more notable person and better makes the case then another article that is based on only a single reference.  I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.  So while that is not a good way of proving primary use, in this case it makes a strong case that there is no obvious primary use so the dab page should be moved.

The blurb as it stands now is below:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHenry Cornelius Burnett (1825–1866) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate States Senator. He represented Kentucky's 1st congressional district during the lead-up to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was expelled from the House in 1861. After the war, he was indicted for treason, but was never tried. He returned to the practice of law, but died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40. (more...)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== A ba  : EDATA_3",dev,0

I'm claiming Jews can influence a race not only by going solidly Dem, but also by deciding not to.  The article I cited states the amount of time candidates spend on Jews is precisely because they (~20% of them) are swayable.  That being the case, narrow Republican victories could also be a result of Jewish response to a candidate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::This being the case, 2000 Florida could be a result of Jewish voters if either: (1) enough Jews were attracted to W.

I don't care what anyone's point of view is, but when they make up words like ``hypergyny`` (which is only used by academic sociologists), the word should at least make common sense and be backed by evidence.  ``Hypergyny`` fails on both counts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``In the U.S., women’s hypergynous tendencies allow higher status men to be functionally polygynous.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy only in the US?  Not only in the US, and not only among humans, but generally, high status males reproduce more.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``In some cultures, women are expected to marry a spouse who is more economically, socially, or politically powerful. Known as hypergyny, this practice is common in India.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis makes it sound odd for women to desire higher status men, while the truth is that this is essentially universal, just as it is universal that men prefer physically attractive women.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Though an expected social norm in America, hypergyny is slowly being replaced by isogamy, marriage between equals, and the marrying 'down' of woman. Many anthropologists ascribe this to increased gender equality between women and men.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is pure nonsense.  As I pointed out, it is simply impossible for women on average to marry up.  No evidence is provided for the above statement because it is impossible for it to be true.  The above is simply a lie designed to make it sound like feminism in America has promoted equality, when nothing could be further from the truth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy point of view, which probably does not belong in Wikipedia, is that feminism has caused American women to become sluts, having lots of sex with high status men outside of marriage and ignoring men of their own status.  I can also reference academic papers backing up this point of view.  If the section on ``hypergyny and isogamy`` is to remain, then I should be free to add a section expressing my point of view.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKEN:Ah, here's the thing: You cannot edit Wikipedia based on ``what you know.``  All content has to be drawn from reliable sources, which a scholarly journal certainly is.  Whether it's an academic term or not is irrelevant to whether it belongs in the article.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Just as an aside, arguing against peer-reviewed published works on the use of the hypergyny concept on the basis that ``you know differently`` is not going to work here. I do agree with you though that some better sources are necessary for the statements in the second paragraph.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The only source sited in the whole section is a book review published on the web, not an academic paper with peer review.  This is hardly a reliable source.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::If the term ``hypergyny`` is going to be used, it should be made clear that it is an term of academic sociologists, and not a term in general use.  And there should be at least one reference to a truly reliable source containing the term.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I just noticed that the second paragraph of this section is a copy of a blog entry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If someone wants to replace this text, there are numerous reliable sources that use the term hypergyny.

NEWLINE_TOKEN:I've added this, see Cat#Skin  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Scientific classification ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:NEWLINE_TOKEN*/Archive 8#Species name, andNEWLINE_TOKEN*/Archive 8#Scientific nameNEWLINE_TOKENThis discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from ``This erroneous nomenclature`` and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name ``cat`` is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed ``Further reading`` section.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {} NEWLINE_TOKEN:MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy.

We cannot do this, for legal reasons. May I invite you to rewrite it in your own words, adding a citation to your source? That would fix the problem. Thanks.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Editors have moved further information to the History article to make sure that we present a coherent and concise description of LFC as a whole. We should have only the most relevant and important info in the main article. E.g. That the City of Liverpool has made a World Cup bid is verging on off topic, especially when LFC's involvement is only with the use of its stadium. The rail station info has nothing to do with LFC in the slightest.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Liverpool's split from Everton was already mentioned, and described in detail in the article about Liverpool FC's history. What facts exactly am I supposed to be ``getting over``?   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Also, I do not like being described as a vandal. Especially when that's clearly not how I've been acting. It's quite insulting. Please read here for a description of what a ``vandal`` is.   NEWLINE_TOKEN*Agreed. Removal of unsourced information, particularly if it may be a breach of WP:COPYRIGHT is not vandalism and saying that it is breaches our policy on personal attacks. Please don't add it back without citing its source, and certainly not without rewriting in your own words in a narrative style, because I'm afraid if you do, you will be blocked from editing here. Furthermore, references to Hitler are equally likely to get you blocked. Please take some time getting used to our policies before going much further. Thanks.  NEWLINE_TOKEN;AbstractNEWLINE_TOKENOK, well we now have a citation- thanks- but merely quoting from an abstract isn't quite there yet.

NEWLINE_TOKEN**Believe it or not, we are trying to help you here, but I've had to remove this university study again- the citation you gave just did not support the content you added, and therefore, your edit failed verifiability policy. You need to take points from a full, published, version, not just an abstract. Even if it is your own work, it is original research and not permitted here. Any further disruption may lead to a block, but at least that would give you some time to read other articles to see how they are written, and sourced.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOK, I've rewritten it to cite the research. There is no need for there to be a section on the research; the article is about the club, not the research.

This attack was the outcome of a premeditated plan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom time to time Syngman Rhee himself and other representatives of the South Korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique had such a plan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs long ago as October 7, 1949, Syngman Rhee, boasting of success in training his army, stated outright, in an interview given to an American United Press correspondent, that the South Korean Army could capture Pyongyang in the course of three days.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn October 31, 1949, Sin Sen Mo, Defence Minister of the Syngman Rhee Government, also told newspaper correspondents that the South Korean troops were strong enough to act and take Pyongyang within a few days. Only one week before the provocative attack of the South Korean troops on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, Syngman Rhee said, in a speech on June 19 in the so-called ``National Assembly`` where Mr. Dulles, adviser to the U.S. State Department, was present: ``If we cannot protect democracy in the cold war, we shall win in a hot war.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is not difficult to understand that representatives of the South Korean authorities could only make such statements because they felt that they bad American support behind them. One month before the present developments in Korea, on May 19, 1950, Mr. Johnson, chief American administrator of aid to Korea, told the American Congress House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that 100,000 officers and men of the South Korean Army, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American Military Mission, bad completed their preparations and could begin war at any time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is known that only a few days before the Korean events, the United States Defence Secretary, Mr. Johnson, the Chief of the General Staff of the United States Armed Forces, General Bradley, and the State Department adviser, Mr. Dulles, arrived in Japan and had special conferences with General MacArthur, and that afterwards Mr. Dulles visited South Korea and went to frontier areas on the 38th Parallel.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOnly one week before the events-on June 19-Mr. Dulles, adviser to the State Department, declared in the above-mentioned ``National Assembly`` of South Korea that the United States was ready to give all necessary moral and material support to South Korea which was fighting against Communism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese facts speak for themselves and need no comment. . . .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe United States Government tries to justify armed intervention against Korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the authorisation of the Security Council.

It is known that the United States Government had started armed intervention in Korea before the Security Council was summoned to meet on June 27, without taking into consideration what decision the Security Council might take. Thus the United States Government confronted the United Nations Organisation with a fait accompli, with a violation of peace.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Security Council merely rubber-stamped and back-dated the resolution proposed by the United States Government, approving the aggressive actions which this Government had undertaken. . . .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe illegal resolution of June 27, adopted by the Security Council under pressure from the United States Government, shows that the Security Council is acting, not as a body which is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace, but as a tool utilised by the ruling circles of the United States for unleashing war. This resolution of the Security Council constitutes a hostile act against peace.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf the Security Council valued the cause of peace, it should have attempted to reconcile the fighting sides in Korea before it adopted such a scandalous resolution.

For example on p10/11 of the source: ``has a government...have a legislative body...have a judicary...have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will.`` - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation/control. All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is ``peace loving``, whether SoP is ``able and willing`` to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed ``peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations`` the ``problem`` criteria is whether it's ``really a state`` (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's ``able to carry out the obligations`` (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::Do you insist on adding such OR/SYN unsourced analysis?

Instead you write ``I think the misunderstanding is that PBS assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations.`` Whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the Good Old Cause or something else, its usage today implies someone who supports their nation, and if it is to be used before the UDI, then what does it mean as (the nation did not exist)?NEWLINE_TOKEN:@ your argument ``The British colonists had made North America their country`` is I think flawed unless you think that Virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the 1770s and the 1860s. Surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots, unless one is using the terms inconsistently. If they were rebels in the 1860 then why not use the term for the 1770s as well? Luckily one can usually substitute the word ``Confederate`` for ``rebel`` so this is not usually a POV issue for civil war articles (but using the word patriot in an article has POV connotations). For example in the main body of the text the first use of the term Patriot is in the sentence ``The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests``. In what way were the mobs patriotic? Even the phrase ``rebellious mobs`` would not be accurate. ``anti-tax mobs`` would be more accurate, but it is probably better just to drop the adjective completely from in front of mobs.

It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``    The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia's liars use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLiars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic.

I think I need to ask you for your help, if you don't mind helping a newbie, since i can see that you've had experience in editing articles, and seem to be an authority on article qualification. Again, I'm new to wikipedia, and I have one purpose here, to have a page for the hockey league I belong to. I have read countless help articles, linking to other help articles, linking to more help articles.  I've read 'notibility', 'articles for deletion', 'deletion policy guidlines', in my efforts to save my page from the few people who seem to want the page gone forever. These people have not giving any advice, just citing everything that's wrong with the page, and nothing that is right.  Can I change your mind on windsor floor hockey league, and, your proposing on deleting it?  I would do whatever possible to comply with the rules of wikipedia and have read quite alot in the guidelines about why the page SHOULD be included. (so many, i donno where to begin -social & recreational clubs have a place on wiki -  -Included in the article is a physical address of where the games take place, some article i read said that stands for something- there's alot of reasons why it SHOULD exist on wikipedia and about two or three small debatable issues about lack of notibility). I included all the league's website and pages, and it's not like anyone is debating the truthfulness of the article, but they do insist on citing the page for 1. notability, 2. More independant sources.   Where i have done the best i possibly can, I included all the links EVER available,   And having said that, ask any of the 80+ families that are effected by this league, in a town, during a time, where 10% of it's population has been laid off indefinitely.   This league is notable to me, and to others, isn't that enough for you?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCan you answer me this: how is this league not notable to the people and families who CARE about it, notibility is in the eye of the beholder. Just because it's not being written about in the newspapers, YET!,  doesn't make it any less notable to the people who would type WFHL into the 'search'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI hope to work WITH you and not against you as i try to save my page, hopefully one man's reason as to why my article is not notable wont erase the many reasons why people like myself think it SHOULD be included in wikipedia. Thanks for reading, hopefully this will convince you to help the cause instead of adding to the fire that's trying to destroy it.     : EDATA_3",dev,0

Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind.

He is against any academic progress and democracy in general. Stating such is; of course, an attack on his character even though he openly worships communist totalitarian regimes here on wikipedia and communist totalitarian dictatorships and dictators. Even when there is vast consensus against him, since he is paid to be here, he knows every possible way to limit such exposure and simply logs complaints against the opposition until they are completely outlawed and banned. Typically this type of behavior is traditional in communist totalitarian dictatorships. My comment was of course a legitimate content comment as all content is monitored and approved by DIREKTOR and his lobby group here on wikipedia. Unless you have something negative to add - don't add it at all because he will have it removed. This is because this topic in itself is still political in modern day Croatia where any type of objective historical discussion is branded as communist revisionism as outlined by one Dr. Ante Birin at the Croatian Historic Institute who recently held a great discussion on the matter. I would like to point out that the user DIREKTOR has directly linked me to 'nazism' - even though anyone with half a brain knows that German National Socialism is not the same as Croatian Ustasism - but of course, that is not an attack on my personal character. I have not been blocked for any relevant reason other than the fact that I oppose DIREKTORs nonacademic claim to all WW2 Croatia-related articles.

Regarding Dr. Pavelic's nationality - Pavelic did not believe in Yugoslavism, he was a self-declared anti-yugoslav and on many occasions publicly -and in written form - argued the idiotic basis of such a movement.

Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I'm being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn't know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Restoring WP:NPOV to the Paris article==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI invite everyone to read again the WP:NPOV policy of Wikipedia:NEWLINE_TOKENEditing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCurrently, the article is heavily biased towards a historical/heritage representation of Paris. The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn't been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFacts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today's Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructures, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airports, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ). I've counted words of each section (including their paragraphs in introduction), and in order to give a point of comparison, I've done the same about London, which is a similar size capital city of a similar country.NEWLINE_TOKEN{| class=``wikitable`` style=``text-align: center;``NEWLINE_TOKEN|rowspan=2 bgcolor=``#EFEFEF``|Field of interestNEWLINE_TOKEN|colspan=2 bgcolor=``#EFEFEF``|ParisNEWLINE_TOKEN|colspan=2 bgcolor=``#EFEFEF``|LondonNEWLINE_TOKEN|- bgcolor=``#EFEFEF``NEWLINE_TOKEN|Number of words||% of total||Number of words||% of totalNEWLINE_TOKEN|- NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|History||align=``right``|3,573 words||align=``right``|22%||align=``right``|2,048 words||align=``right``|17%NEWLINE_TOKEN|-NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Heritage||align=``right``|4,277 words||align=``right``|26%||align=``right``|204 words||align=``right``|2%NEWLINE_TOKEN|-NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Culture||align=``right``|2,545 words||align=``right``|15%||align=``right``|1,661 words||align=``right``|14%NEWLINE_TOKEN|- bgcolor=``#B9CFDB``NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Subtotal||align=``right``|10,395 words||align=``right``|63%||align=``right``|3,913 words||align=``right``|32%NEWLINE_TOKEN|-NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Economy||align=``right``|673 words||align=``right``|4%||align=``right``|727 words||align=``right``|6%NEWLINE_TOKEN|-NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Demographics||align=``right``|852 words||align=``right``|5%||align=``right``|1,605 words||align=``right``|13%NEWLINE_TOKEN|-NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Transport||align=``right``|819 words||align=``right``|5%||align=``right``|1,693 words||align=``right``|14%NEWLINE_TOKEN|- bgcolor=``#B9CFDB``NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Subtotal||align=``right``|2,344 words||align=``right``|13%||align=``right``|4,025 words||align=``right``|33%NEWLINE_TOKEN|- bgcolor=``#BDBBD7``NEWLINE_TOKEN|align=``left``|Overall total||align=``right``|16,388 words||align=``right``|100%||align=``right``|12,131 words||align=``right``|100%NEWLINE_TOKEN|}NEWLINE_TOKENIt's worth being mentionned though that London's culture section is entirely dedicated to today's culture.

Also, reviewing this, it seems that his Titstare comments were a trigger for his firing but not the real reason or cause, they just set some things in motion that led to people reviewing his Twitter feed. In that sense, I do think it is of due weight with respect to this controversy because it is perhaps part of the aftermath. As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture.

While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site:NEWLINE_TOKEN: http://www.alevibektasi.org/xalevis1.htmNEWLINE_TOKEN: It is written that NEWLINE_TOKEN``X. Alevi-Bektashi HumorNEWLINE_TOKENAlevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis’ approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (fıkralar) that have been collected.NEWLINE_TOKENThis first joke reflects the Alevi attitude toward the legalism of the five pillars``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage NEWLINE_TOKEN: http://www.alevibektasi.org/makale_engl.htmNEWLINE_TOKEN: In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like ``adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.``  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's ``suspect`` and ``racist``.  But given what we read from another source, this seems an overly simplified and inaccurate depiction of the ``jokes`` section.  I would like to hear an argument against these lines of evidence from freestylefrappe. `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment). At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Band.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENAs The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher). The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room, the mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENElwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with a U.S. flag and an Illinois flag).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom “Bones” Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie “Too Big” Hall, Steve “The Colonel” Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, and Murphy “Murph” Dunné) known as “Murph and the Magictones”, are playing in an empty Holiday Inn lounge, “The Armada Room”, and are readily convinced to rejoin The Blues Brothers’ Band. Trumpeter “Mister Fabulous” (Alan Rubin), now maître d' at a restaurant, is more of a challenge to persuade (“you ain′t never gonna get ’em outta those high-payin’ gigs”), but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him with some dining-room hijinks. En route to meet saxophonist Louis “Blue Lou” Marini and guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Blues Brothers drive through a rally of neo-Nazis (upon whom Jake comments “Illinois Nazis—I hate Illinois Nazis!”) and adding another enemy to the The Blues Brothers’ growing list of pursuing parties. Marini and Murphy are working at the soul food restaurant on Maxwell Street, in Calumet City, Illinois, which Murphy owns with his wife (Aretha Franklin). Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group obtain new musical instruments and associated equipment from Ray (Ray Charles) of Ray’s Music Exchange, in Calumet City, Illinois, on loan, pending payment from the proceeds of The Blues Brothers’s Band’s pending ‘triumphant return’.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJake is unable to book a gig in advance, a  : EDATA_3",dev,0

However, there is an issue with that, in that we put the language instead of the script due to the fact that it helps identify the etymology of the word, which the script does not do. Also, there is a translation after the script, which means that using the language name would be better. Additionally, which Devanagari script is well known, what about names derived from languages like Punjabi or Malayalam. I hope you understand the point of view. Cheers. /@edits `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

As you observed, the paragraph made no sense after that hack job.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn my opinion, the original paragraph touched on a point of interest, one that people might consult an encyclopedia to confirm or deny, and offered verifiable facts that attest to the extistence of a point of confusion (i.e. co-starring in ``The Legend of Billie Jean``, and misinformation published on a DVD of ``Supergirl``).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow you have reversed my reversal.

No editors were attacked and WP:BLP is for ARTICLES, NOT talk pages.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Your statement ``there is a contingent of editors that feel the need to hide the fact that there are actually famous people in Hollywood that support child rape`` is most certainly an attack upon a ``contingent of editors`` which include the ones who have acted against your campaign to accuse multiple persons of supporting child rape, all the while ignoring the comments regarding reading the actual petition and trying to understand the actual difference between supporting Polanski's actions and protesting the manner in which he was arrested. And for the record, WP:BLP most certainly covers talk pages. See WP:BLP#Non-article space, which says ``Contentious material that is unsourced or poorly sourced and not related or useful to making article content choices should be deleted, and even permanently removed (``oversighted``) if especially problematic``. Both your claim about editors' motivation and your statements against Scorcese are attacks. Please try to contain your bad faith.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: You guys are delusional. I'm sorry that your celebrity hero worship blinds you to the fact that Roman Polanski raped a child and that is not okay.

Have fun guarding your precious Hollywood articles from anyone that you slightly disagree with.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo, delusional is thinking that because someone disputes the manner in which you present your viewpoint, it equates to being in favour of raping children, and that's not the first time you've made that type of comment.

If I notice you make any comments that go against WP:BLP or that attack editors, I will revert them, but that is the only interraction I ever want to have with you.

For One America News Network ,  if you have such sources, it may be possible to rewrite the article; otherwise,  it will not be possible until such sources are published. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENAs you expand the article, remember that a Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press releasedon't praise the organization or person, say what they do Don't include material that would better belong in an advertisement or a web page, such as a detailed list of products or of executives or branch offices.Remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  first it's a copyright violation, but, even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM (permission that irrevocably gives everyone in the world the right to copy, reuse, and modify the material) , the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitable. (Thus, there is generally no purpose in giving permission; it is better to rewrite.) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInclude only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not include material that would be of interest only to those associated with the subject, or to prospective clients/purchasers/students/supporters/donorsthat sort of content is considered promotional. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs reviewing administrator,  I removed the prod tag and placed an ``underconstruction`` tag on the article which should give you a few days to find sources before it gets listed for deletion.

In the English language, there are some names pronounced differently in the United States than in the United Kingdom.  A good example is the name Maurice.  Maurice Gibb, of the Bee Gees, pronounced his name the British way ``MOR-ris``.  Meanwhile, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire pronounces his name the American way, ``More-EES``.  I believe we should use the pronunciation that García Bernal himself personally uses, seeing as it is his name.  Therefore, the correct pronunciation would be ``gar-SI-a``.  After all, a person can choose however they want to pronounce their own name.  If he starts pronouncing his name the Spanish way ``gar-THi-a`` then I would agree that it is pronounced like that.  But until he changes the pronounciation himself, we must use HIS pronounciation.  `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

They exist for the same reason that this one should exist  numerous high-quality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves.NEWLINE_TOKEN::* A wide array of reliable sources have identified this article's topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis, separate from the broader history of human subject research in general. Per WP:NOTAB_TOKENLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider ``bad`` (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of ``bad science``) does not mean that it is ``biased`` to have an article on them. WP:NPOV does not say that articles can't be about ``bad things``. It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it. I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying.

103492084.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe can have material split across three articles, if that is the best way to do it.  Or we can have two articles, with a redirect from new antisemtitism to contemporary antisemitism, or vice versa.  The advantage of multiple articles is that it gives a sharper focus on a specific issue.  The disadvantage is duplication.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problem I have with the current article is that it isn't clear to me what the distinction between new antisemitism and 'old' antisemitism is, or even if there is one.  Some duplication is OK but when I have no way to decide what should go into new antisemitism and what should go into antisemitism, I think there's a problem.  The advantage of contemporary antisemitism over new antisemitism is that it has quite a clear definition.  The advantage of new antisemitism over contemporary antisemitism could be that new antisemitism is not just antisemitism in the here and now but somehow something different.  That we have a history of new antisemitism suggests that a difference exists, but I don't see what that difference is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe current introduction says that new antisemitism is ``the wave of antisemitism that escalated, particularly in Western Europe, after the Second Intifada in 2000, the failure of the Oslo accords, and the September 11, 2001 attacks.`` But it then says what is different about new antisemitism is that old antisemitism ``was largely associated with the political right.``  So I'm confused.  Is it the distinguishing factor the timing, or is it more to do with the source, in which case perhaps we should be talking not about new antisemitism but about new antisemites; a new chorus singing an old song?  In the introduction we mention anti-zionism in passing, but we don't make clear what the relationship between it and new antisemitism is, we just say that there is one.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe history section talks about a Soviet new anti-Semitism, and says this antisemtism was ``close to its modern form``.  But it doesn't explain what close means.  Presumably there are important ways in which it is similar and ways in which it is different, but the article doesn't explain what they are.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurther down, we seem to be equating new antisemitism with anti-zionism.  Maybe this is the crux of my issues with this article.  We have anti-zionism; hatred of/opposition to an jewish state.  We have anti-semitism; hatred of/opposition to the jewish race (common usage. technically arabs are also semites, but lets not go there now).   We can also identify anti-Israel sentiment; opposition to some or all aspects of Israel.  These things all overlap, but it's hard to say that any of them are the same, or a subset of each other.  For example there were jews opposed to the creation of Israel because it was man-made, not created by god.  And some dislike of Israel is anti-semitic, but not all of it.  The boundaries are fuzzy, but for each of these concepts there is a clear and unmistakable core.  I can't say that for new-antisemtism.  I can't identify what new-antisemitism is that old-antisemtism is not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo me, new antisemitism seems to be a grab bag of an expression that mixes some different issues:  1. the apparent resurgence in antisemitism, which I suggest properly belongs at contemporary antisemitism; 2. the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate/illegitimate criticism of israel, which I suggest belongs here, or possibly at anti-zionism; and 3. the changing nature of the anti-semite (left/right/arab/european/russian/...) which I suggest belongs at contemporary antisemitism and/or at antisemitism.

No political body existed by that name in the Empire of Brazil. The Brazilian imperial parliament was called ``Assembléia Geral`` (General Assembly). The General Assembly was a bicameral legislature, comprising the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (see Political Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, arts. 13 and 14). Accordingly, I propose that references to ``National Assembly`` should be changed to references the General Assembly. Wikipedia should not invent names for the political institutions of a country  .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:When creating a section in an article's talk page, you should do it at the bottom.NEWLINE_TOKEN:The name ``Assembléia Geral`` can also be easily translated to National Assembly.

The other articles about Brazilian imperial history also use the translation ``National Assembly``.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I have found both ``National Assembly`` and ``General Assembly`` used in references. ``National Assembly`` seems to have a long history in 19th century English-language press and other accounts. I assume that ``National Assembly`` was used to distinguish this assembly from other types of assemblies (i.e., not the national legislature) for the benefit of their English-language audience. I have introduced the Portuguese title for the assembly at the points where it would first be seen by readers. Readers can decide the translation for themselves.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Speech from the Throne paining==NEWLINE_TOKENIn the painting by Pedro Américo (called Speech from the Throne), the Emperor is portrayed not actually delivering the Speech, but standing, before seating on the Throne to deliver the speech.

However, given that prior edits on this point have generated confusion, I will post this proposal here and wait until tomorrow. If there is no objection then I'll make the change. It seems to me that the editor Lecen had finally agreed that the use of ``delivering`` in the caption did not reflect the reality of the painting, but now another editor (Astynax) has again resorted to the use of that language when making an edit intended to reduce the size of the caption. I agree with Astynax that the mention ``in the opening of the General Assembly``, can be suppressed, but I submit that to return to the word ``delivering`` is misleading.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:One more time: when you create a section, you must do it at the BOTTOM of the talk page. There is no reason to be so precise about the caption of the image.

Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those ``universes`` or ``worlds`` were not present.

Second, Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Q-celtic branch of the Celtic language family, thus the Irish of Patrick's day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language.

36211428.0,"SDATA_3 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen I tackled this article, most all of it was a copy and paste from a 'mandobanjo' website. It is not laid out very well, tends to ramble and does not stick to the subject of mandolins. Anyhow, to do my part, I replaced a section in the history part. I believe it gives a succinct account of the mandolin's origin. The facts- names, places and years- are footnoted. Afterwards, It became apparent that the beginning of the article had to be re-written since there was really no definition of a mandolin. So I did this (footnoted also). Now as for the question left in the sandbox regarding mandolinos and mandoras, I will leave it to another to rewrite the definitions and histories of those instruments. When that is done, there will be no need to add to the mandolin's definition to try to expain why it is different from these similiar instruments. (basically, however, they are at a different tonal range, among other things).NEWLINE_TOKEN   : EDATA_3",dev,0

This permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated,  and the algorithm parallelized.  If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.

To be clear, Government funded sources include academia, and they are also less verifiable if not freely accessible.  What makes basic income special is that, unlike virtually every other political proposition, the Champion of basic income gains no privilege whatsoever over other citizens, and so the only reason to champion UBI is to provide freedom and dignity to everyone.  The relevance is that there is no business model for power accumulation behind it, and that affects the sources available.  Limiting information sources to entrenched power sources (Government, academia and corporate) stacks the deck with biased point of view in favour of power structures, or in the case of the state of this page, makes it impossible to describe UBI.  There is great content available on the web for UBI.  Academic work is more timid, less accessible, and often of lower quality than other research on UBI.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_3",dev,0

137619391.0,"SDATA_3 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The distinction I would draw is whether the content is published and accepted.  Wikipedia:No original research#What_is_excluded.3F gives a list of seven criteria for determining whether or not something is original research ... but really what it boils down to is whether or not you can find other secondary sources making the same claim.  I had never heard of this tomb before this evening so obviously I don't know enough about it to say what is and is not accepted science in this respect.  ;)  From what you are saying, it sounds like there are two questions - (1) is it appropriate to discuss the symbolism findings in the article and (2) if so, is it appropriate to cite your work.  In the case of the former, it depends on whether or not this has become an accepted finding.  Is it still a theory or has it gained acceptance?  Have other authors picked up on it and do they cite it as accepted truth or as a new theory?  The primary reason for the original research policy is that there are constantly new theories coming out about everything - Jimbo (the founder of Wikipedia) originally mentioned physics, but I think it applies to any field.  Some theories are good for a term paper or thesis and never see the light of day again.  Others become accepted truth over time.  Wikipedia is not the place for giving a sounding board to new ideas and theories - we wait until they are accepted.  The second question is whether, if this content is to be included, it would be appropriate to cite your book.  I believe, as I said before, that you (personally) should not add it, but should let someone else do it - that's just basic journalistic integrity - we as individual editors don't promote our own stuff.  Blogs are almost never considered appropriate ... so I really don't think having a link to your blog would be a good idea.  Sources on Wikipedia should be peer-reviewed journals, newspapers, etc, where more than one person is responsible for the content.  Blogs are generally a bad thing.  I hope all this helps ...

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am a biographer by hobby, and am using the OurStory service beacuse I like the timeline they provide.  It is a service that I couldn't find else where on the web, and as a history buff and biographer, I think it is valuable.  I run a number of profiles on their service, which are told collaboratively with other people on the site, and I particpate in other people's biographical projects.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI do respect the fact that external links should provide information that positively adds to the discussion, or provides valuable information that is not already in the entry.  And I understand that in some cases the information on my timeline projects does this and sometimes it does not.

You can see my comments on those individual discussion pages.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut, as a final thought, I hope that you can appreciate that, in and of itself, a biographical (graphical) timeline is a useful external reference tool.  It is something I have been looking for for a long time.  For example, when I created my biography on Barack Obama, in my research I could not find a biographical web source that provided dates for important events that make up his life (including the wikipedia entry, offical Illinois sentate, or US Sentate biographies, or even his current campaign page).  There was nowhere I could go to get a sense of the major events in his life, without reading 3 pages of text.  So, in a case like that, I think the timeline is an external reference that is contributing to the entry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you think it is best, I can alter the way I leave links, so that it does not say Our Story in it.  I just followed the example that is widely used on wikipedia for external links to IMDB.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you would like to further the general discussion, please post on my Talk page again.  And, please engage me on the discussion page for the individual entries where I am adding the links back.

Some have even changed their vote from oppose to support.

Anyone with a basic familiarity with the Irish language in a modern context will be able to tell you that ``Fianna Fáil`` means ``soldiers of destiny`` - fáil being the genitive of fál, destiny, and fianna the plural of fiann, soldier, much as in ``Amhrán na bhFiann``, the soldiers' song, and Lia Fáil, the rock of destiny.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::The text doesn't state that ``men [don't know] how to.`` It states something that Kinsey concluded, and it is clearly attributed to Kinsey  ``Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.`` We are allowed to mention researchers' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It's also what I just stated above: ``Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying.`` It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that ``having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship.`` I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::We don't have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn't mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The ``Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact`` line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources.

Just because a few historians in the past suggest does not mean they are making assertions. Hence trying to get away with naming the rare historians and saying belive. Dozens of scholarly texts I've ever read and perhaps hundreds assert that the medes have no direct cultural/lineage to any modern day people. It may only be surmised (since no large migrations of peoples took place) that the mede genetic make up is mixed with the peoples of the core population in the Zagroas mountains(though still only a weak amalgamation) and then diffuses out to the peoples in the surrounding area, this includes the kurds but is not limited too them. The medes are very obscure historically and they only had conquered a small area of modern day Kurdistan (the people of that area then were considered foreign to the medes no doubt) for a short period before Elam change all that.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Dorvaq, thank you for the pointer, where I see ``Newspapers, for instance, almost universally refer to any indicted but unconvicted criminal as an alleged criminal.``  Agreed; I use 'alleged' whenever writing about someone where crimes have been charged but not yet proven in a court of law.  Perhaps what I'm trying to ask is more of a common-sense question to which the answer is so obvious that no one has thought to incorporate it in a policy or guideline here.  Trying again, ``Once an accused criminal is convicted in a court of law, is it not both inappropriate and biased to insist on using the word 'alleged' when writing about the charges of which he's been convicted?``  Maybe someone has a pointer to an old discussion or arbitration about this?  It seems that it must have come up in the past.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I'm pretty sure there is no discussion involving the generic use of ``allege`` (or any derivative thereof) specific to before-and-after trials.  However, there has been many discussions of this sort on individual article pages involving criminals. But, most of these discussions have been initiated by either anonymous users or users who contribute very little to Wikipedia besides the article in question.  Perhaps your best bet would to start there unless someone else can provide you with something more informative.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Anyhow, I don't believe this needs to be incorporated into policy/guideline beyond how the word has already been treated.  In terms of law, to allege is to present without proof or without first proving.  Therefore, to state the convicted crime of an offender as an allegation is inherently contradictory. Wikipedia is dedicated to quality and integrity — anything contradictory fails on those two points, but that's my opinion. —   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Ah, that last paragraph hits the nail on the head, thanks.  Nothing like logic to prove a point.  I came upon the Megan Kanka article by chance and I remember the case quite well.

More people read Wikipedia than any other encyclopedia. That doesn't mean Wikipedia relies on a democratic definition of truth. If we did, we would have to state, as a fact, that God exists, because a majority of the world's English-speaking people believe that claim to be true. Fortunately for God, he's still got some gaps to hide in, so for the time being the existence of God is not a scientific question. But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful. Wikipedia can certainly report on who believes what. We have a List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming.     : EDATA_3",dev,0

Many may have been assimilated into the Syriac Christian culture. The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity.

The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of ``The/the Beatles`` midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to ``the Beatles`` mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, ``When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.`` I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a ``shot across the bow`` may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to ``grow the fuck up`` and other less rude demands. It would seem all five or six GabeMc supporters consistently spell Andreasegde's name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections I have witnessed. That and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental, to me. Man, I hate this stuff! I just can't believe this is happening on WP with all these rules and tough nuts. )   `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

Other people agree with me. The ``good editor`` you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 (talk • contribs) `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of ``God is ever a geometer``, which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL   `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate. I just find is unusual that Crusio's page is so much larger than those who are far more notable. I think Crusio's page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate. I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have.

I do not know why BogHog changed to vcite or to vcite2 after he took over maintaining the Diberri tool.  Nor do I know what that means in every case.  The case I know about is that autism used vcite instead of cite because of load time issues (Eubulides developed vcite for that purpose, but Eubulides is gone), and I remember at some point having a conversation with BogHog about the vcite vs vcite2 issues ... but the rest fades in memory.  That may or may not mean BogHog explained it all to me once  ... and I may or may not have understood at the time.  When I use Boghog's new Diberri tool, I edit the output to use the old standard form, for consistency in citation style.  And I continue to use the vcite format in the autism suite.  That we now have a mix on FAs is because new editors may not always respect CITEVAR, and I may not catch them all.

On the contrary, groups of Masons have discussed together and made certain decisions about their relations of amity with one another This is clear discriminate behaviour. As regards notability, clear the discussion about whether UGLE recognised the Rite of Memphis-Misraim in the 1850's clearly involved political decisions taking place in consequence of the Revolutions of 1848. Involving such key figures at Louis Blanc and Guiseppe Garibaldi, this is clearly highly notable people and events. And there has yet to be any serious discussion of the role of revolutionary freemasonry in the International Workingmen's Association, which will also of couse link us into the very contraversial figure of Mihail Bakunin. Onfortunately these issues are all far too notable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENb) verifiability Well, this also relates to falsifiability and what is considered to be the truth. I have found the writings of Charles Peirce very helpful in this respect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENc) Likewise  raises the issue of original research. This means that Wikipedia is immedtiately functioning at the level of intertextuality - i.e. the information contained on a wikipedia pagelinks other pieces of text, from which peopel may infer facts or events existing outside language. I would further argue that teh distinction between original research are the difference between relying on publisjed sources and unpublished ones, institutional denioted by the separate organisation of archives and libraries. I agree with [User:ALR|ALR]] that the task is a bit daunting, however if we can entice the anarcho-capitalists who produced such wonders on teh anacrhism talk pages a while ago I am sure we can create a suitable masters carpet of information from which Mason and Cowan can freely, fairly and friendly learn from and inform their fellow sentient creatures who have access to the internet. `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

Sources of evidence include recognized peer reviewed publications, credible and authoritative books, reputable media sources, and other reliable sources generally.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Harbrace Guide to Writing books (both of them, published and distributed to colleges throughout the U.S. referencing the film) falls under credible and authoritative books.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince I am a long-term donor of Wikipedia, it seems that this is a direct violation of what Wikipedia professes their site is.

Seriously. I don't want bad blood between us.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI do have a POV, of course. We all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is ``the`` trad POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links/further reading (not ``sources``), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to ``An Orthodox Hannukah`` or ``Reformed Readings for Hannukah,`` but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add ``a traditional Catholic site`` tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled ``a traditional Catholic site`` or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a ``conservative`` or ``neo-conservative`` site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains).

Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the ``Customs of the Liturgical Year`` section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I'm not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase ``attacks on Pope John Paul II`` with regard to the footnote about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an ``attack`` but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, ``to the face`` when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad ``movement`` out there, and we have as much ``right`` to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to ``Anglican Rosary practices.`` I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled ``blog`` or ``[[monograph|monographs]``. It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word ``a traditional Catholic site`` or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear.

Pathetic vocabulary skills, general lack of anything resembling cultural knowledge, and the lifestyle of the perpetual slacker round out the package nicely.  This is, unfortunately, what most people think of when you say 'gamer' unless you're talking about the pen and paper variety, which has it's own features (among them, the thankful lacking of the word ``n00b``) that set it apart.  All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake's seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it's all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.

488136213.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title ``Humanistic Buddhism`` is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into ``Buddhist Humanism``. If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term ``Buddhist Humanism`` is appropriate. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHistorically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: ``Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community`` http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the Lotus Sutra: “Buddhist humanism:  It is a philosophical perspective that reflects the core spirit of the Lotus Sutra”NEWLINE_TOKENBuddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as ``Chinese`` Buddhism and ``Japanese`` Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing ``passport`` added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity.

NOT Lu!! See, for example, long-form periodic table. Petergans (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBoth conventions are common and are often a source of debate. The group 3 element article tries to explain the story. Itub (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENCommon? I've never seen it. Lu is a lanthanide in all the standard inorganic texts, Greenwood & Earnshaw, Cotton & Wilkinson, Housecroft & Sharpe, Shriver & Atkins ... The debate was concluded long ago. Petergans (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENJust last month there was an article published in J. Chem. Ed. continuing the debate (advocating La and Ac in group 3), and it cites a few books and articles that follow the opposite convention. See [1]. There are also four letters about this topic in the same issue.[2] Itub (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENUnbelievable! In 50 years as a chemist I have never, until yesterday, seen a periodic table with Lu anywhere other than in the lanthanide series. Web elements is a first for me and, as far as I'm concerned, just another example of nonsense on the web. IUPAC puts La under Y. There is no ambiguity about it, just that the lanthanide series convertionally starts with La and is usually written separately. Petergans (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENThis is not nonsense on the Web. There have been many textbooks published since the 1980s that put Lu under Y (I can't say whether they are the majority or the most influential). Just one example: Wulfsberg's Inorganic Chemistry. Wulfberg explains his reasoning in a footnote. In this letter to JCE, the authors looked at 35 textbooks for what they call ``flyleaf periodic tables``. If you look at the figure in the letter, among the textbooks published since 1984, 7 put La under Y, 7 put Lu, and 2 put all 15 lanthanides like IUPAC. IUPAC's table is ambiguous. It doesn't put any specific element under Y; it puts all the lanthanides there! Itub (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENI'm flabbergasted. I thought elements were put in the same group because they have the same electronic configuration. The trivalent ions of Sc, Y, La, Ac have a noble gas electronic configuration. Lu(III) does not. How can it be put in the same group? (Don't answer that). I stand by the word nonsense!Petergans (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENI'll dare to answer despite your request. I'm relatively neutral on this issue because I think it is largely an arbitrary convention, but I enjoy playing devil's advocate. 1) the periodic table predates knowledge of electronic configurations, and sometimes exceptions are made in the name of chemical properties (or even in the name of layout, in my opinion), such as putting helium above neon instead of above beryllium (although some tables do put He above Be!) 2) the relationship between the electronic configurations of Y and La is essentially the same as the one between Al and Ga: Al and Ga are both s2p1, but Ga has a full d shell that Al doesn't have; Y and Lu are both s2d1, but Lu has a full f shell that Y doesn't have. Trivalent Lu also has a noble gas configuration, in the sense of having no s and p electron in the valence shell, same as trivalent gallium. 3) if one looks at the neutral atom, La has the same configuration as Y, but that's an anomaly in that it doesn't follow the aufbau rule. But we don't move elements such as copper and palladium to another group just because they happen to deviate from aufbau. Finally, one slight disadvantage of putting La under Y is that you end up with a discontinuous d block in the long form of the periodic table, which looks a bit odd in my opinion. Itub (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKEN(no indent) The counter to that argument is that, in the spirit of Mendeleev, elements a grouped together because of similarities in chemistry. Therefore it is the electronic configuration in the ``group oxidation state`` that counts, not the configuration of the atoms. Cu is the classic example [Ar]4s13d10 in the atom, but in Cu(I) the relative energies of 4s and 3d are reversed and it is the s electron which is lost on oxidation of the metal, so Cu sits comfortably in a group with Ag and Au. For Au, the f electrons are discounted as they belong to the filled 4-shell comprising 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe can argue this one for ever, but what concerns me now is that the basic image of the long-form periodic table, which is used in WP for all the elements, puts Sc and Y above Lu and presents La and Ac as a group on their own. I believe that this is misleading as it does not clearly distinguish the lanthanide and actinide series from the main-group elements and transition metals. long-form periodic   : EDATA_3",dev,0

I must say, both in the music and lyrics. On ``BYOB,`` the chorus is extremely pop-like (from an alternative rock POV) and says ``Everybody's going to the party have a real good time, Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine`` which is an incitation to dance and ``move with the beat``. On ``Lost in Hollywood``, one part says ``All you bitches put your hands in the air`` which is another incitation to ``moving with the beat`` and is sounds like something a rapper would say (that's my opinion).NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Nu metal guitarists generally make liberal use of palm muting. - SoaD uses a lot of palm muting. First examples that pop up to my mind are ``BYOB``, ``Radio/Video``, and ``Old School Hollywood``.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Another common technique with nu metal guitarists is the use of de-tuned strings whose lower pitch creates a thicker, more resonant sound. - A technique that SoaD uses. ``BYOB`` is in Dropped C (I believe), but anyone with the slightest guitar knowledge would notice that SoaD are tuned down.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*This is typical of nu metal bands in that guitar solos are rare in nu metal songs in general, and when they do appear they are often short. - SoaD have very few guitar solos, and if they do they are extremely short or do not emphasize on technicality (which, in general, is what most metal bands do in a guitar solo).NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Nu metal bands often feature aggressive vocals that range from melodic singing akin to pop and rock, guttural screaming and shouting from various forms of metal, hardcore punk, and rapping. - SoaD uses (most of the time) melodic singing and shouting, and in some occasions uses some rap-like vocals (most notably in their ``Chop Suey`` intro and verses). Although it is not, properly speaking, rap, the link must be considered. I would still like to remind you that rapping does not necessarily make you a nu metal band, and that being a nu metal band does not necessarily means you rap. There are nu metal bands who don't rap, and they are still nu metal.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Normally, nu metal songs have a song structure of instrumental introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, sometimes another verse but almost always ending with a chorus. - This is characteristic of SoaD. Most of their songs (I'm not saying all of them) have a very simple ``verse-chorus-verse`` structure (as well as the slight variants).NEWLINE_TOKEN:*It is generally louder in the instrumental parts and the choruses than in the verses. - Listen to ``Attack`` on their last album.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Another thing I'd like to mention is that Serj Tankian worked with Limp Bizkit (a well known nu metal band), Saul Williams (a hip-hop artist), M.I.A. (a rapper), and The Notorious B.I.G. (another rapper & hip-hop artist). The link to hip-hop and rapping with System of a Down's lead singer is therefore established. I don't have the material that Tankian produced with those artists, but seeing how those artists are predominantly hip-hop and nu metal (in Link Bizkit's case), it is probable that the material is similar to hip-hop and nu metal in style. the 'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge' is used by every genre of music: rock, country, punk, so that doesnt make them nu metal eitherNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:SoaD is nu metal. Cheers Emmaneul  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI feel that the only reason they were labeled as Nu Metal is because all of the hard/metal music that was popping up around that time was following Korn and adding the Hip Hop element. Because they happened to play music that was more hard or agressive than a rock band, they were considered Nu Metal.NEWLINE_TOKENAs for the things that  said, I can easily say how they are wrong. When he gives the reference about BYOB, and how that line ``everybody's going to the party have a real good time, dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.`` That line is metaphorical. BYOB stands for bring your own bombs, going to the party is metaphorical for going to war, blowing up the sunshine in the desert is like dropping bombs in Iraq. So those lines dont have anything to do woth the crowd moving to the beat. The detuned guitar doesnt make nu metal either. metallica did their st anger album in drop c. and almost every hard rock/metal band today uses drop d or lower. the 'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge' is used by every genre of music: rock, country,  : EDATA_3",dev,0

This is understandable, since you work for Medcan and you surely want the Wikipedia article to include only promotional information. However, Wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth. NEWLINE_TOKEN- If wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth, then you should say that even though the Danish Meta Study brings up valid arguments regarding physical examinations and their impact on health outcomes, generally speaking physical examinations are widely accepted and useful healthcare screening tools. I suspect every first world country recommends medicals with a General Practitioner - your comment is stating that these countries health organizations and policy makers are incorrect. And that medicals schools are also incorrect in their lessons.  And we may as well change how medicine is practiced and treat people when they get sick, not try to catch disease early.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe meta-study itself is fairly recent (just two years old). It was brought to us thanks to the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration. I see no reason why a Danish meta-study would be inapplicable to Canada, though you are welcome to try to convince me otherwise.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI won't dispute your point that most people in First World countries undergo routine physical examinations. And I won't dispute that they are customary. But have they been proven to be useful? Not to my knowledge.NEWLINE_TOKEN- This is an astonishingly closed minded comment.  Medcan alone has hundreds of cases where we've saved peoples lives, improved there lives, provided them insight for future care, etc.  The word ``useful`` is vague - useful as in leading a healthier life?  Absolutely.  Useful as in keeping someone alive who has a terminal illness - probably not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think there is more than enough here for you to understand why we have such an issue with this comment on the Medcan wikipedia page.  If this was an Encyclopedia - there is not a chance it would be posted.  There is no facts or evidence that the Danish study is 100% true - and Medcan's model of care is not just to diagnose, but to also help people through lifestyle modifcation and coaching.`  : EDATA_3",dev,1

And that face there at top of Orion and the same face as the Sphinx, IS the face of Allah/God there for all to see and there projecting on the side of the great pyramid, before that gigantic desecration of Allah by Muslims.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition, this alignment at the time of ORION RISING (at sunrise) ALSO predicts the time of the coming of Allah/ God / Jesus (about NOW) the reason for the alignment.

It's excellent, he has a comprehensive iblyography and notes, and uses previously published peer reviewed scientific papers. It has a very comprehensive feel to it.

By using a little bit of mathematical induction you can conclude that it has a googol amount of zeroes.

625926447.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom a purely WP:LEAD point of view, the article has several sections devoted to cores and the requirement for ferromagnetism is stated prominently.  It is a reasonable summary to have the ferromagnetic core requirement in the lead.  The argument that not all ferromagnetic materials make good cores is irrelevant to the statement that all cores must be ferromagnetic.  This is the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent; all A are B is not invalidated because some B are not A.  That some new material for cores might be discovered that is not ferromagnetic is WP:CRYSTAL and also irrelevant, certainly not encyclopaedia worthy.  I am not convinced that there are any genuine electromagnet applications of air-cored solenoids.  The solenoid in its actuator role has a metal armature which is effectively acting as a core.  `  : EDATA_3",dev,0

(You accused of ``ownership`` as well, but I already explained at ANI how your interpretation of editsum was not correct.) Why I removed body content at Sozin is complex, but it wasn't something as stupid and petty as ``spite``. It's a big sorrow to me to have to leave ortho chess article editing. (I have loved it. I had no idea, the hostile and ruthless culture at WP, and the editors who revel in that environment to throw lies and smears and do bullying would ruin it for me. But I should have known better. The signs were early and my love of editing made me want to ignore them.) The deal is, Dennis, I regret ever creating that article (and there were only two others) for the orthochess project. I just regret it. And that regret, also somes with pain. And sorrow. But in the end, I wish I never edited for that subproject. I met some nice talented editors doing (e.g. ,  whom I learned to understand better and appreciate), but there were some bad apples, and the environment allowed them to make hay with me. That wasn't nice. When defacto subproject leader Quale defamed me consistently by complimenting my detractors, and disparaging my good-faith efforts out of prejudice, well, that's life in the big city, it's political and nasty here, and I'm not willing to suck up to it. I'd rather leave. So I did. Seeing the three articles I left behind I created, that I can no longer expand, made me sick. I began to sincerely wish I never created them. So I made mercy killings of them. (Have you seen One Flew Over the Kookoo's Nest? There's a mercy killing in that movie. Was it spite!?) You apparently have no idea what complex emotion caused me to delete those contents, so, a quick & dirty answer you accuse on a public board, is that of ``spite``. (Why do you jump to suppose bad faith like that? You should think about that. In effect an accusation of ``spite`` is a dig of my character. I've never toilet-papered a house or lawntree in all my life. Or played a mean trick on anybody for fun. Why should I start now? To accuse me of mere spite is to say I'm no better than a juvenile delinquent. And you don't see the insult value and personal affront in that? You are Mr. Editor Retention. And yet you seem clueless what I as editor have gone through, who has done a partial quit of Wikipedia  the quit of a subproject [orthochess]. The emotional toil is real and genuine. I know I cannot prove that, only attempt to explain to you. But please note how you jumped to bad faith explanation, and affront, and maybe why you would do that.Like I mentioned, the emotions were complex. Take one of the other three articles, for example: Paris Defence. Some of the above was at play with the deletion of that artice's body content, but there was something else, too. I had to fight tooth-and-nail, to get that article to 'Keep' status, and a WP:CHESS member also who is a deletionist kept pestering me about why the article couldn't be 'Merged'. The reasoning for 'Delete' and 'Merge' were all faulty, and I painstakingly and patiently tried to reason and explain. To little success. But the article stayed. Only through my perseverance, I guess. I never demanded the article stay  I don't think I even !voted at the AfD for it. I simply made comments because even then, I had disassociated myself as project member due to already giving up on the level of civility from one editor initials CPL who you favored at your Talk against me, when I went to your Talk in good faith consel session, and there was no counsel discussion, just diaparaging criticisms of me, and I withdrew. That is when I never trusted you again. (Your compatriot Elen of Roads of course came in to render supportive disparaging criticisms of me, there and on her Talk, without end. You see how ``friendship`` explains all on the Wikipedia. Arguments are for losers, it seems.) The reason I deleted body content of Paris Defence is because I worked so hard, so very very hard, for the good, and consistency, of WP chess articles then, to keep it, and prove it. (CPL was saying the opening didn't even exist. That it was a joke of a 3rd move by Black. Yet he was willing to tell everyone at any opportunity that he's a ``chess Expert`` rating, in repeated boasting. I worked so very hard hard hard to keep that article, I improved it during the AfD, and it was amazing to me, because those imporovements didn't seem to matter (no one said they did), when they were in fact central and vital and the whole point. So where does the sorrow come in? After working so hard as I did, for the reasons I did, I was alone. Alone alone alone.

See also the edit history of Wallace Wattles and Charles F. Haanel and their related discussion pages. Hrafn claims to merely be ``enforcing verifiability`` of biography pages, but the only pages he targets are those related to Christianity and New Thought. He summarily deletes material without discussion. He cuts biography lengths by 50% to 75% and then nominates the articles for deletion based on the ``non-notability`` of the bio subject. He has on one occasion deleted an entire page without discussion. It is very likely that, as evidence of his campaign of effacement and deletion is accumulated and follows him, he will either stop engaging in this practice or be proposed for blockage from editing spirituality and/or religion articles.

I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally ``thought`` five hours was ``about`` two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as ``less than 2 hours`` (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended ``about`` tends to support a story of an innocent ``estimate``.  But ``less than`` doesn't. ``Less than`` is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson.

For a small minority of songs, such as ``Eleanor Rigby``, L and M disagreed and the article describes the disputed authorship. For cases where there was a 60/40 split, adverbs like ``predominantly`` or ``mainly`` make sense, but not in cases where there is no dispute that L or M was the sole author.NEWLINE_TOKEN* While it is true that the lead singer was often the main writer of an L/M song, it is not always true. ``Every Little Thing`` is one such exception.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Other people who contribute to a song—such as a producer or soloist—typically do not get a writing credit for their contribution.

You had corrected the name ``Stadtzeitung`` we have in note #4 of this article into ``Stattzeitung``, because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the ``Stadtzeitung für Freiburg`` and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the ``Stadtzeitung für Freiburg`` online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the ``truth`` would now be, erroneously, ``Stattzeitung``. A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for ``pseudo-science``, ``severe methodological flaws`` and ``factual errors``. Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the ``christians``. But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the ``severe methodological flaws`` and ``factual errors`` he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of ``pseudo-science`` was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVan Hooff is refered to as a ``Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands`` in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called ``Professor Associate``. Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a ``professor`` on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of ``numerous books and articles`` but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVan Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most ``judges`` do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category ``Pseudowissenschaft`` (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they ``discovered`` ``Van Hooff``, taking him as ``proof``, without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is ``only`` a quotation! ;-)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo much about verifiability and truth.

A method book, I might add, with proven misinformation contained therein. Among many errors in that book: In the front matter the author states falsely that ``Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar``. That is, even though Yepes ubiquitously indicates eight (not four) missing resonances in various articles and interviews as referenced here as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: ``The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDespite discussing this last issue with you numerous times, you still made the folowing statement: ``there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four ``resonances`` or eight is a non-issue.``  That is, even though eight clearly does not equal four and both sides are clearly not describing the same thing, you still defend your support of misinformation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEven though I've explained this before, and my site explains it in detail, I will say it again:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe western musical scale has 12 notes per octave. On the guitar, Yepes observed, four of these when palyed on a treble string induced a unison resonance from a bass string. These four notes are E, A, B, and D. If any octave of any of these notes is played on a treble string, a bass string reproduces it in unison. If A5 is played, A5 is reproduced by resonance on a bass string. Yepes observed that the other eight notes do not have the same resonance. These are C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#. By adding four strings to the guitar tuned a singular way (C, A#, G#, F#), all twelve notes of the octave, played anywhere on the treble strings, now have unison resonances from bass strings. If C#4 is played C#4 is reproduced on string 10 (F#). If F#4 is palyed, F#4 is reproduced on strign 10 by resonance. If both C#4 and F#4 ar played, string 10 produces both the pitch of C#4 and the pitch of F#4 simultaneously. This is a proven fact of acoustics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Janet Marlow claims there are only ``four missing resonances on the six string guitar`` (and in her book even attributes this to ``Narciso Yepes``), it is totally false. Yepes said eight missing resonances (C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#) not four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb). Marlow knows that because she has (in Soundboard magazine) referenced an interview with Yepes (Snitzler, L. 1978. ``Narciso Yepes: The 10-String Guitar: Overcoming the Limitations of Six Strings``. Guitar Player 12: p. 26.) in which Yepes very clearly indicates which notes do and do not have resonance. Yet she has published at least twice the disinformation that Yepes added four strings (resonators) because four resonances were missing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you still have a problem understanding this, I am happy to meet with you and illustrate it on an actual 10-string guitar, since you've never owned/played one.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_3",dev,0

Not a high-ranking terrorist. Adnan Shukrijumah is the operations leader for North America. He's not the chief of operations. Bill Roggio confirmed that at the Long War Journal. I suggest you get your facts straight before accusing me of changing edits so they can be what I like. And yes, you are brown nosing. And thanks for tracking all of my edits. You are also a stalker.

You don't dispute that it is a documented teaching of Mediaeval Muslim scholars, you seem to be arguing that we all have an obligation not to report this fact because it doesn't fit in with your teaching.  But the way wikipedia works is, if Mediaeval Muslim scholars taught such a thing, and it is documented, then we are allowed to say that Mediaeval Muslim scholars taught such a thing and that it is documented.  // `  : EDATA_3",dev,1
