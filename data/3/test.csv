None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were ``innocent`` of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the ``preponderance of the evidence`` supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were ``innocent``.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, ``enemy combatants``.  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were ``enemy combatants``.  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.

A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::WRT his ``innocence``, you assert above: ``There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...``  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established ``early``.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Soke Morihei Ueshiba ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI noticed that the ``Soke`` is the name for ``founder of a style``, (martial arts). Should Ueshibas article include this title?—Preceding unsigned comment added by   •  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Absolutely not.  Soke is a title used by some Japanese martial arts to refer to the founder or head but I have never heard the term used in Aikido.  In Japan Ueshiba M. is sometimes referred to as Kaiso which means founder and in fact this term is far more commonly used than O sensei which seems to be a Western affection.  I have actually run into Aikidoists mortally offended by another art using the term O sensei as if it somehow slights Ueshiba M..  Both Kaiso and O sensei tend to be used primarily within the Aikikai and its newer derivatives.  In the older styles it is much more common to just hear Ueshiba sensei but then again they do not have the confusion of familial succession.  Personally I would like to see O sensei removed from the articles orther than a mention that some Aikidoists refer to him as such but I think that would raise a few hackels. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Hackles be dammed I reduced the number of O sensei's in the text and clarified its usage a tad. I have never heard one Japanese Shihan use the term O sensei while in Japan.  Not saying they don't just that its not common. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Well it's fine by me. I only asked because I noticed Gozo Shioda is referred to as ``Soke Gozo Shioda`` on the official Yoshinkan website. When I first saw it I figured that if Shioda had a ``Soke``-title then Ueshiba should too. Oh, by the way, my own aikido club (Ki-aikido) usually just say ``Ueshiba sensei`` or ``Ueshiba``. I cant actually remember anyone using the phrase O-sensei other than in a few introductionary speeches.NEWLINE_TOKEN::: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInteresting point about Yoshinkan I am more familiar with them using the term Kancho but it is their choice. Perhaps they didn't use Kaiso as not to confuse Shioda with Ueshiba.  Soke would not be a wrong usage for either man just in the case of Ueshiba it was not the term used.  I am going to ask a Yoshinkan Honbu Instructor his opinion on this.  At Shodokan Honbu (Tomiki's dojo) it is always Ueshiba sensei and interestingly Tomiki is always refered to as either Shihan or sensei - no other titles.  In Ki society how is Tohei sensei refered to?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Tohei? Well I suppose it's mostly just ``Tohei-sensei`` and/or ``Tohei`` for mentionings in day to day training.

70507312.0,"SDATA_3 :  `::: Yes, that was an RPJ rant. But criticism articles really are required sometimes (here's a great example) and often they create clutter if all the separate objections to an idea are left in place. The general rule is that the minority views can be collected as a subarticle, so long as care is taken to treat them as a subarticle by somehow summarizing them in the main article (this does not have to be exhaustive), and vice versa, which probably we should be careful to do in the main JFK assassination article. And so long as rebuttal on both sides is a part of both articles, which I hope we've accomplished here by having a good section on the one-shooter WC view in the JFK assassination theories article, and mentioning that other views than the WC's exist, in the main article.In line with Wikipedia's semi-policy of assuming good faith, the creator of the new article is probably sincerely convinced that there is so much information about a certain aspect of a subject that it justifies a separate article. There is no consensus whether a ``Criticism of .... `` article is always a POV fork. At least the ``Criticism of ... `` article should contain rebuttals if available. And the original article should contain a summary of the ``Criticism of ... `` article. I know I'm going to get flack for pushing so heavily for the WC view even in light of the fact that supposedly it's not the most popular view among the general public. Unfortunately, the general public's view is not informed, and is warped by the slick Oliver Stone JFK, which no movie producer is going to spend as much money to rebutt with a movie which is true to facts as we know them; plus the HSCA shocker with the dictabelt, which got way more airtime than ITS rebuttal, later. All of this being symptomatic of one of the problems which drives WP:V toward untruthfullness, which is that TRUTH is quite often dull and not very entertaining, and sometimes it's hard to find spokespeople for it. Jimbo Wales thinks that if something is true it should have plenty of citable supporters, but sometimes that's just not the case.

Also, I didn't ``remove an external link ``without cause.`` I explained my cause, both here and in the edit summary.

While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.  Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another, and some decidedly non-Mormon communities as well.  The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City, South Dakota.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In addition, a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah, including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the ``Mormons`` and the ``Gentiles`` during the territorial days of Utah.  Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here.  The LDS Church owned the store lock, stock, and barrel.  And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.   `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

670005017.0,"SDATA_3 :  Born John Webb, John Silas Wilson A.K.A. “BIG HITZ” was born in Chicago Illinois along with eight siblings. Problems in the household ended or so it would seem with his mother losing the rights to all nine of her children. “BIG HITZ” then lived in foster homes, orphanages, and group homes for about five years before a family he was staying with took him in. “BIG HITZ”, 13 at the time was happy but his new family loved government money more than they loved him and when it came to his music “Hip Hop-Rap”, the family that took him in didn’t want him listening to “Hip Hop-Rap” or writing it. But “BIG HITZ” had his first taste of “Hip Hop-Rap” by listening to a rap group called Bone Thugs N Harmony and later, another rapper named Nas. “Big Hitz” had been writing since the early age of 13, and by the time he was 14 years old, he took his first step into a studio to do his first song called “ I represent”. Having a “Hard Knock Life” and hitting a rock bottom couldn’t stop “BIG HITZ” from writing and pursuing the American dream. Through writing and doing music, he found sanity in all of the madness that was going on in his life. At the age of 19, “BIG HITZ” moved in with a friend from High school and formed a group called “BASS & TREBLE” After successfully putting together a Record called “ THE BASS & TREBLE 7 HITZ ep. “BIG HITZ” had a huge sense of accomplishment but the Record went nowhere. After splitting with his friend and partner, “BIG HITZ” set out to build a strong solo career. After recording a solid demo and song catalog, “BIG HITZ” decided to move from Michigan to California.living in michigan brings you to present day. Written By Gisele S.

I'm not sure if you even understand how your edits are disruptive, so I'll try to explain. Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

It was for the sake of whimsy. That impulse has left me, and I make the promise that it will not return. I do not retract anything that I said. The bigger issue which I have been addressing is the flaw within the system itself. After repeated requests to actually read what I'm saying here and what I actually said on the Beat Generation page, you clearly have mistunderstood me. Your claim that you have ignored evidence in the prosecution of my punishment is one among many disturbing signs of the flaws within the Wikipedia system. What you call extraneous issues are indeed central issues. You have done little to convince me otherwise. For example, the sockpuppetry was a bad idea when considering rules of civility, and I won't let it happen again. It was a good idea in that it was funny, but like I said, that's out of my system. The bigger issue  a central issue, not extraneous  is that admins claimed I was being dishonest. This is evidence of laziness and lack of real concern for the real job you are meant to do. If the real problem is that I was uncivil, then I apologize and make an honest promise that I will never do it again. I don't believe that really is a central issue. I'm not blaming anyone else for me being uncivil; I chose to do it and have never claimed otherwise. The problem is Wikipedia is a toilet. Why is it a toilet? Wikipedia is a punchline. Why is it a punchline? Because people who passionately care about truth get angry (even if it was pretend) on occassion? No. I realize uncivil behavior can be a contributing factor in that it can fail to lead to a positive change; I was practically begging for a positive change on the Beat Generation page, and nothing was happening. Certain other editors were relying on Wikipedia rules to stymie progress. Block me or don't block me, I don't care (and judging from the history of this process and my history with Tao  I fear you'll scan this for trigger words, see ``I don't care`` and say, ``If you don't care, why are you wasting my time?`` totally missing the point of what I'm actually saying)  but please look in the mirror and think about the real problem here. If you skip the first part where I genuinely apologize for the actual infraction and said I would never do it again (just as I genuinely apologized for the infraction last time and said I would never do it again  and I can keep saying this over and over again) and if you once again just look at this part and claim I'm focusing on extraneous issues and incorrectly claim that I'm blaming others  blaming others for my rant? no, please actually see: my rant is my responsibility, and once again I apologize for it  whatever you do, despite my lack of faith in anyone's ability to genuinely take some time and think about these things, please just consider what's right and what's wrong here on a larger level while in the short term focusing on my genuine heart-felt apology.

I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Considering that ``Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term ``belief`` was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed ``evolutionist bias`` you claim is on the Creationism page.

42663641.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Language in Saskatchewan==NEWLINE_TOKENCorrect me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the 1988 Mercure decision held that Article 110 of the  North West Territories Act determined that Saskatchewan was bilingual.  In a context in which jurisdiction over language rights not specified by the Charter is undetermined, this means a conflict between Bill 2 and the North West Territories Act exists.  From the CanLII website:  ``Article 110 embodies procedural rules that give rights to individuals and, in fact, those rules are to some extent framed in terms of rights.  They are language rights or language guarantees as all the cases in this Court from Jones to Société des Acadiens make clear.  Section 110 was not entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act was passed.  This, like the continuation of s. 110, is entirely in accord with the legislative history of these provisions.  Many of the questions raised about the reach of the protections like those accorded under s. 110 have already been determined in recent cases before this Court either under s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867, s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, or ss. 16-18 of the Charter.  All of these provisions are differently drafted but they use similar expressions and there has been a marked tendency to give them a similar interpretation.  Section 110 was obviously modelled on s. 133.  The language rights accorded by s. 110 are substantially the same as those accorded under these other provisions: R. v. Mercure, 1988 IIJCan 107 (C.S.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234; Paquette v. A.G. Canada and A.G. Alberta, 1990 CanLII 37 (S.C.C.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1103.``NEWLINE_TOKENGiven all this, what can we say with authority about what the official language(s) in SK is (are)?

However, User:Tajik claims this is nonsense and reverted the page. I rather not revert pages but settle the dispute in a nice manner on the talk page...something he does not responds to. I tried this on Kandahar talk page but did not get any responses from User:Tajik. I don't know what to do with this User:Tajik. It is not just one page he reverts but every page I visit.

Pubdog and/or BD2412, could you separate off those into one requested move discussion, using the multi-move requested move option?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: Maybe some other concern here can be addressed simply.  Specifically, I don't see any problem with there being double redirects for existing articles.  If there's a redirect to an existing individual post office article, and the article is moved, that does indeed set up a double redirect (a redirect to a redirect to the article).  But, bots come by and fix those automatically, within a day or so.  Nothing needs to be done; this is not an issue to worry about.  If a name change is agreed to, then just moving the article suffices.  And then because of dab style rules, the name shown in the dab page could/should be updated to show the actual article name.  The county NRHP list-article need not be changed, it can still show the NRHP-official name and reach the article by a redirect (perhaps temporarily by a double redirect but a bot will make it a single redirect very soon).  Pubdog does that address your concern?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: More complicated are cases where there is no article, and the topic is listed as a redlink in this dab page plus in a NRHP county/city/state list-article plus possibly also in a local town article.  Then to implement a change requires finding and changing all of those to point directly to the new preferred name.  You can't set up a redirect to a non-existant article; it will be deleted promptly.  In these cases i would prefer for a stub NRHP article to be created immediately as that is easier and allows for verification that all the related pages link to the right article.  BD2412, will you please agree that we can do that or comment otherwise, rather than proceeding some other way, in cases where a change of name for a non-existent article is eventually agreed upon?   `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

If so we can go ahead and move it into the article and get started on the second part.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In 1974, Tina Barber, of Shiloh Shepherd Kennel in New York State, began  developing a unique line of German Shepherds. Her goal was to preserve the type of  dog she remembered from her childhood in Germany; dogs who are good family  companions, exceptionally intelligent, mentally sound, big and beautiful - similar to  Chuck Eisenmann's dogs from The Littlest Hobo.  After years of selective breeding  and genetic research, she seperated her dogs from the AKC in 1990.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In 1991, The Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club of America (SSDCA, Inc.) was incorporated.   Shilohs were originally registered dually through the FIC and AKC, but after  difficulty with standards verification, the SSDCA decided to open the first  Shiloh-only registry, The International Shiloh Shepherd Registry (ISSR). Due to some  documentation problems with the original ISSR registrar, a special program was  designed by The Complete Computer Place (TCCP) to process registry data for the ISSR. Since then more than 4,000 dogs have been registered with the ISSR. They also  maintain a database with over 45,000 ancestors in order to properly calculate various  factors within the limited genepool.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks .:..:.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Since there haven't been any objections, I'll go ahead and move this to the article so we can focus on working the second section.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis may be too late, but I think the fact that the ISSR was started in 1991 should be made clear and also that the TCCP started to maintain the records in 1993. There are other statements in that second paragraph that don't seem quite right to me either.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Not too late at all, there's no time when an article is considered ``finished``.  I did notice that some dates are missing, like the TCCP you mentioned.

This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of ``Chinese White`` (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally ``flake white`` is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. If someone has more information on this, please mention it here; otherwise when I come back I'm going to delete that paragraph or water it down (no pun intended).`  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

This resonates with the call by the late founder of Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini for Islamic unity and resistance against the West, and that's also one reason the Houthis are claimed to be supported or influenced by Iran. The other ground for their tolerance is their opposition to Salafism/Al-Qaeda which is widely known as an intolerant, extremist and terrorist Islamic group which has engaged in sectarian infighting and division in the Islamic Ummah rather than staging any real, honorable resistance against Western domination. They have in fact destroyed the public image of Islam by committing all sorts of wrongs and excesses such as indiscriminate violence against non-Salafists and non-mulims and pretty much anyone who doesn't adopt their ideology. I'm elaborating on this to help better make sense of the Houthi ideology and such characterizations offered by the Yemeni professor. Also see how this is in line with the Newsweek identification of Houthi descent cause as being shared by all Yemenis. Houthis are genuinely inspired by Shia Islam but that's also exactly why they are striving for indiscriminate well-being of all muslims.

However, you have not listed bias or NPOV, you have listed two ``OR`` statements. Well, what they really amount to is misplaced clauses. We could easily delete ``to solicit donors`` and ``to assist Elder in the process`` and move them elsewhere, or move the footnotes and add other footnotes. But isn't it interesting that if that had been Elonka's concern, she could have deleted just the clauses instead of the whole sentences? Have you read ?NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::Also, as I will point out at AFD, the simple facts are that this usage was created entirely by Paul supporters, it received prominence solely due to Paul supporters, and upon reaching prominence it has been used by six campaigns.

She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPerhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input.

You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe BUAV is not a ``controversial organisation``.

While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOnce I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBoth of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom.

229746824.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== TIBIN VARGHESE (CREATED BY) Hypertension  ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHypertensionNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENHypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the ``top`` number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the ``bottom`` number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEffect on the EyesNEWLINE_TOKENHigh blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathyNEWLINE_TOKENHypertensive retinopathyNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENDamage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.NEWLINE_TOKENBone LossNEWLINE_TOKENHypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSexual DysfunctionNEWLINE_TOKENSexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.NEWLINE_TOKENPregnancy and PreeclampsiaNEWLINE_TOKENSevere, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.NEWLINE_TOKENThis condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels.

It is based on five years of work here at Wikipedia (not always the prettiest, I might add). I think it summarizes the opinions of a great majority of editors as to how to handle scientific situations. This proposal serves as a nexus between WP:NPOV and WP:RS for cases where we are dealing with observable reality. It is needed because there are a lot of editors who don't seem to understand what entails best-practices when writing a reliable reference work about observable reality. I don't pretend that this version is perfect, and would appreciate any and all additions, suggestions people may have for getting to some well-regarded scientific standards.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNote that these standards would apply only when discussing matters directly related to observable reality. These standards are inspired in part by WP:SPOV but avoid some of the major pitfalls of that particular proposal. In particular, the idea that SPOV even exists is a real problem. However, I think it is undeniable that we should have some standards for writing about scientific topics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSee also WP:SCI for another failed proposal that dovetails with this one. I hope this particular proposal is more in-line with the hole I see in policy/guidelines for dealing with these situations.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have added a section that I think necessary for balance. I doubt you will like it, but I think it necessary to express the rue meaning of POV.

This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPrior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you live near Baton Rouge and you are interested in being a Wikipedia Campus Ambassador, or know someone else from the area who might be, please email me or leave a message on my talk page.    : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

8565981.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I am pleased that others have joined this enquiry but I am already dismayed to find that someone has found it necessary to sweep the ``Jewish Question`` under the carpet when reference on this Talk page had already been made to one incident involving a ``Final Solution`` of the Jews in England. I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called ``Race laws`` of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (``they killed Jesus``). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Now move along to 1297 and ``bingo!`` = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in ``ethnic cleansing`` by wholesale murder and mayhem.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say ``me too`` (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

633212801.0,"SDATA_3 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Topic ban ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRelating to  (and let me be honest, I'm not up for a protracted debate, I'm just here to offer a perspective that you are free to ignore).  The problem is how you phrased the issue.  If you are claiming admin abuse, you need to be specific.  If you are claiming it is no longer needed, then your opinion of PBS's original ban is irrelevant.  When it comes to General Sanctions, admin are given broad and sweeping authority, because the community wanted them to have a hammer to deal with problems.  Whether you deserved it or not, I have no idea, I didn't do that research and don't have time.  I'm talking about procedure here.  Kosh's comments just muddied the waters, unquestionably admin have the authority to do moratoriums and the like on these articles under General Sanctions, and do topic bans.  Authority isn't debatable because it is clearly spelled out in policy, so Kosh ended up making it less likely others would participate when debating something that is clearly not debatable, and PBS was on topic in addressing those points.  Your points got lost in the mix.  It happens.  And Dougweller and RGloucester also piped in, it wasn't just one person.  It was just one person taking your side, but he was mistaken on the procedural points.  Even DGG jumped in to support the moratorium, and he isn't prone to jump into fires.  Then Obsidi joined the fray.  So 5 people participated, besides yourself, not just one. The problem being that you guys debated the right of the admin to impose sanctions (and he clearly has the right), instead of the circumstances of your situation, which is why 80% of the people disagreed with you and Kosh. You complain that only one admin has spoken, but that isn't true.  Obviously, PBS is an admin, but so is Dougweller and DGG, neither of which has a reputation for being heavy handed.  Quite the opposite, actually.  In reality, he could have put a one year moratorium on name changes and it would have been 100% supported in policy, but he chose a very short and reasonable period.  You might not LIKE it, but the community voted specifically to give admin that power.  If you had not muddied the discussion up by mixing both issues, your topic ban and his authority to issue a moratorium, you would have had a better chance, although odds are that the topic ban would have stuck because there wasn't any abuse in his doing so that I could see.  It was his judgement.  Disagreeing with it doesn't make it abuse. And the fact that it was only three months....that is the shortest topic ban I've ever seen, so obviously he wasn't trying to be heavy handed.  Sometimes, you just have to accept that you don't have a case, and this one could easily be closed as ``no consensus to make any changes to existing sanctions``.  Again, I'm not up for debating, but I could care less about these articles, and if you want an honest review from an experienced admin, you just read it.  -  `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

In this case, I'm sure I didn't respond particularly appropriately, but the whole thing is irritating.  It's particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot.  And also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense.  I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed ``unsourcedness``, managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.

I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

It is an evolving standard defined by what its editors determine to be acceptable, and personally I don't agree with the view that the priority is to write lengthy prose in the style of Encyclopedia Britannica. I've been around since 2007, Jeh has been around since 2005, and Dsimic has been editing a lot since 2013 (in other words, enough to get a very good idea of how Wikipedia's anarchist system works). I'm glad that Jeh prefaced his statement with ``in my opinion`` because that's what Wikipedia is about, and no personal statement (or even an essay such as commonly-cited arguments to avoid essay) is law. We debate a lot. I know just how much sucks but it's the way it is. Now, whether or not product lists are not-so-good articles is (debatably, if you you're axiologically inclined) an empirical and subjective question which could be most reliably answered by surveying our users, or our editors if they're not your priority. In my experience, lists are great for their purpose, and as a power Wikipedia user and editor, I've derived enormous benefit from them - and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like Comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from, say, the dozens of references I've added to articles like Tort, Trust law, or Economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics. Lists in general are not easy candidates for ``good articles``; as I recall, back around 2008 or so there was a campaign by a couple people to to delete a lot of list articles on that basis and on the duplication with categories, but when I pointed to WP:CSL, the steam was taken out even though that didn't change the sensibility of the decisions.  In any case, you are welcome to boldly make and advocate for changes, and I reserve the right to express my own opposition within the limits of my available free time. )NEWLINE_TOKEN:::As an aside, I mention the views of users seriously - it has been pretty well empirically shown that oldtimers like myself are actively hostile to newcomers (as documented by Aaron Halfaker ().

We knew they were Germanic before that. Are you implying that there is a connection between Dutch and Frankish ``ethnicity``? That connection, though it is probably there, is not very direct over a thousand five hundred years...NEWLINE_TOKEN:I don't know why the fact that a Frankish-derived language (Dutch) being spoken in a certain region (the Netherlands) should force us to believe that the Franks were originally from there. Of course the two facts are related, but the fact of the language being spoken there does not itself tell us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Franks any more than the fact that a Latin-derived language is spoken in Belgium tells us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Romans. Again, I understand the connection, but it is not made on linguistic analysis alone. This is why most books/articles on the Franks that I've read (Wallace-Hadrill, Bachrach) don't mention Dutch. Your comment about Franci seniores (what does the Franci superiores have to do with anything?) does nothing to explain to me the importance of their language. Their well-attested written language was Latin. Why not mention that? In fact, it tells us far more about the Franks than that they spoke a proto-Dutch language.

The two COS's that you mention in support of your argument are clearly work against you. In the James Baker article, who is far more notable than Emaneuel, it says that his father was a lawyer. That's it.  In the John H. Sununu article it states his father's profession and where he was from. Also more than this article. In Alexander Haig, a 4 star general and far more notable than Emanuel, there is nothing on his father. In H. R. Haldeman, it says that his father donated money to the Republican party. If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]]. Secondly, its not a POV.

What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included.

You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.

Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called ``senior staff`` who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMAYBE SOMEONE COULD INCLUDE THIS IN THE ARTICLE AND MAKE IT LESS HEAVILY BIASED.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks, sorry for the rant.  `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

110367126.0,"SDATA_3 :  `Jackson didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on ``We've Had Enough`` four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support all his siblings and parents. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, ``Dangerous``, and it was thoroughly mediocre music. Almost all of Jackson's remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - a meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album weren't good, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, but the less said about that the better. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire the disgraced former King of Pop. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's fans.

When this article was renamed as 'Taiwan' from 'Republic of China', the original stance by the admins was that this article was to talk about the Republic of China as a whole, with only the title to be renamed as 'Taiwan'.  However, some people jumped ship and created the (mainland RoC) article and ported everything there.  Creating another 'RoC as a whole' article will be very controversial, and to be honest, people are tired of arguing for this and that.  You can try to write one, but you will see a lot of hate coming from most of the community (Greens will argue RoC = Taiwan, Reds will argue RoC = dead, Blues are just not there anymore to back you up)    : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content.

With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7`` Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThough, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi.

I would argue that my statement could be equally applied to any of them or other banned users for a similar reason: each of them failed to uphold the fourth pillar, although in a variety of ways and intensities, and was banned for that.  Malleus has the distinction of being the most prolific content creator being up for a ban in my memory.  The content he has created has is not in question, and he has had an admirable pattern of contribution to the encyclopedia... but that's not sufficient.  Much like Betacommand, Malleus has been shown repeatedly that his style of interaction is insufficient, and he has chosen to continue it.

You don't know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAre you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs the living Master able to reveal Knowledge?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, that's why you call him a living Master. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGuru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWill this Knowledge save us from rebirth?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGuru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.

For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPeople through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the ``old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.`` I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, ``You need peace.`` When people said, ``Tell us of the scriptures,`` I said, ``Look within you.`` When people asked, ``What is your qualification?`` I said, ``Judge me by what I offer.`` To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLong after Rawat was ``only eight`` he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn't cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

This situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it deleted for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it).

Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a passable first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. Me, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so crap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively documented).

375543289.0,"SDATA_3 :  `== Administrator intervention against vandalism ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you for your reports at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. I find that you are a reliable contributor, and frequently make useful reports. However, you do sometimes seem a little too quick to jump straight to final warnings and AIV without milder warnings first. It is certainly not necessary to always go through the whole sequence of level 1 warning, level 2, level 3, level 4, but in almost all cases there should have been at least a couple of warnings, and an immediate ``final warning`` to a new user without previous warnings should be reserved for extreme cases, such as serious personal attacks. One other point is that it is worth thinking whether ``vandalism`` is always the right label. For example, you warned and reported Brendo1337 for vandalism, but to me his/her editing looked more like experimenting than vandalism, and a word of advice to experiment in the sandbox instead of an article may perhaps have been sufficient. I certainly do not wish to put you off, as you make very useful contributions to vandal fighting, as I have already said. However, you may find it helpful to consider my suggestions.

The stub types (templates or categories), which were not proposed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, do not meet the standard requirements for a stub type, either through being incorrectly named, ambiguously scoped, or through failure to meet standards relating to the current stub hierarchy or likely size, as explained at Wikipedia:Stub. Please feel free to make any comments at WP:SFD regarding these stub types, and in future, please consider proposing new stub types first!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is worth noting that stub templates are virtually never created for independentist regions until such time that they are recognised internationally by a significant number of countries, as these stub types tend to become the targets of potential edit-warring (something which has far more far-reaching effects on templates than it has on articles). Thus, for example, there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus, since it is only recognised by one country. If Abkhazia and South Ossetia become recognised by more than just one country, then feel free to propose the creation of stub types for them. Until then, it is generally accepted practice with stub sorting for them not to have separate stub types. ... `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

Sorry for not replying on the WikiProject page - sometimes I have an immediate opinion on a topic and I will reply quickly, and sometimes I need to think about something, so I take some time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In this case, I guess I'm not sure about your proposal.  The templates certainly look good, so there's no issue there, but I'm weighing the pros and cons of another set of navigation boxes.  I think there are instances on Wikipedia where proper use of categories and list pages are probably sufficient to navigate a topic, and other places where navigation boxes really are desired.  For example, many athlete pages have an excessive use of navigation boxes, in my opinion.  Take a look at Toni Sailer, for example.  At least those five navigation boxes now utilize the show/hide feature - that page was very cluttered before.  Even so, I'm not sure that it is a natural way for readers to want to navigate through Wikipedia.  Do we really need a navigation box to go from one winner in a specific event at the world championships to the next?  Wouldn't it be just as easy to have a ``See also`` section with links to List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing and List of Alpine Skiing World Champions and navigate from there?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It's not exactly a parallel situation, but perhaps the concept is similar  the question to be answered is do we really need this new set of navigation boxes (which will number around 350-400 if we make them for all events) or are a set of categories and the existing medalist lists sufficient?  I currently don't have a solid opinion on this myself, so I haven't offered one in response to your request on the WikiProject page.  However, if you have a logical position to support whichever path you take, and can lay the foundation for a consistent implementation across all events (not just diving), then I would support you either way.  Consistency is my biggest concern here.  Hope this helps,  `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

It would be understandable that this section existed if Jared Taylor is known for his anti-Semitism or (more importantly) finds himself being the subject of journalists who cover his alleged Holocaust denial. After all, Wikipedia is a terciary source that relies on publicly verifiable secondary sources that document subjects in a NPOV fashion. The fact is, after checking Factiva, Lexis-Nexis, Google News, and JSTOR I cannot find a single article in a reliable mainstream source that associates him with Holocaust denial. Furthermore,  even the Anti-Defamation League does not accuse Taylor of such things. Right away, the alarm bells should start to sound based on those two facts and we should start scrutinizing a  little more carefully what is and is not relevant for this biography.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm not suggesting that inconvenient facts and criticisms found in reliable sources cannot be included in this article. I simply have not found them. As it is written now, I think what we have is clear violation of Wikipedia's undue weight policy in a living person's biography.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, speaking of biographies, there is the all-important policy points for  writing biographies of living persons. Specifically, we are told to ``do no harm.`` Is it harmful to create an entire section on Tayler's alleged ``Holocaust denial`` based on one journalist's question and Taylor's one-line response?

The purpose of this spelling was to erase the linkage that the Romanian national movement was trying to install with the Daco-Romans, the ancient people who came to be after the Roman invasion to modern Romania. No one, except perhaps to Hungarian nationalists, uses it today, but it still remains in some important and reliable history books. So would you use that spelling just because it existed in many books during the early 20th century? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLikewise, the term ``Palestine`` for the ``holyland`` was used by Romans after the Jewish revolt and their explosion, and much later, it was adopted by the British and consequentially, by the Arab national movement in Palestine/Eretz Israel. As stated above by Breein1007, the use of the term in old books (when there was no political entity there yet, and when there was no one to fix the mistake) doesn't justify using it today. It's no justified because it's an historical distortion, and it's not justified because it's a distortion used to manipulate people into accepting an Arab-Palastinian narrative. Well, feel free to project your political stances, but not in a definition of Hummus. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf I were to replace ``Israel`` with ``Palestine`` that would have not only been an anachronism (for 4,000 years ago it was not known as Israel), but it would also be a politically inclined decision (although in even more ancient history books, like, say, the bible, the term ``Israel`` is widely used to describe parts of modern Israel and the Palestinian Authority). You're hiding behind a supposable academic and scientific argument to instill your narrative, which I have no doubt seems very academic and scientific to you. Whereas I was merely suggesting to use a very dry and neutral definition - The area which is currently known as Israel and the Palestinian Authority.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease refrain from projecting your political views with the word ``Palestine`` into this article on a foodstuff.

37144574.0,"SDATA_3 :  `IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the ``Children of Queen Ester.`` Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGenetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians.

The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple ``revolutionary brigades,`` militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,`` said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN'''A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow dou you see the bold part?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

I'd rather  or someone else would take a stab at it, but otherwise I could take a stab at this idea on the next week or so  UNLESS someone now wants to say ``we gotta have that beatable games section``, because a rewrite will be probably just a waste of time if more than one person wants to fanatically keep that section as it is.

I should have checked out the status before joining in, and it was only later that I realised that this wasn't the person that I actually know. It was clear after reading through the entire history that something was definitely not right. Geoff is quite rightly furious and is taking every step possible to find the protagonists. He has asked for his account to be suspended until further notice as he does not want this sort of thing to be repeated. I was very curious as he normally keeps his involvement in Templary quite private. There are however a few people out there who he has exposed for fraudulent activity and who will do nothing to get back at him. I am also very upset and can understand if editors do not want me to help out. Geoff's advice is to not get involved if these sort of problems can occur. But I am fairly good at reference checking, spelling and grammar if you require any help. I will also understand if you feel that my premature support without checking a real identity is disbarment to future assistance. Whichever way I wish you the best with the article on a subject that we are all like to study and promote. Geoff has emailed me to also pass on his wishes to all concerned and hopes you will understand his personal wish not to get involved. He is, though, another that wishes everyone the best of success in this article and is sorry that other people have been caught up in someone else's vicious attack on him.

825305.0,"SDATA_3 :  oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants.

DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'.

Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal!

They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the ``Bobover Rebbe``, who can use the name Bobov.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBerkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThink for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a ``mamshich`` of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a ``mamshich`` of Sanzer Ruv.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTry to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPutting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe.

The Album received a score of 60 from Metacritic, which several editors wanted to show as ``generally positive,`` because two highly influential reviewers, Rolling Stone and Spin, lauded the album.  Dan56 used Metacritic to ``verify`` his POV that the album was ``mixed,`` and then went on to revert any attempts by the editors to inject any positive reviews into the the first paragraph of the ``Critical Reception`` section.

Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here  It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission.

It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence.

The English vocabulary is huge, not once there are 100 different words for the very same object with most cases it's unnecessary (probably it's related to the expansions of the British empire). I realy think that German and English are among the hardest languges to take control of. Spanise on the other hand, is very friendly..    : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

In fact, I have fought for quite a while to have ``British Commonwealth`` used in WW2 articles, when it is factually correct, rather than the technically incorrect ``British Empire`` or ``British and Commonwealth``. It's an ongoing battle. Use of ``British Commonwealth`` in infoboxes is justified in cases such as the British Pacific Fleet (active in 1945), Commonwealth Corps (invasion of Japan) and the 1st Commonwealth Division (in the Korean War), where units were specifically organised along those lines. However, in the Pacific between mid-1942 and early 1945, the UK representation was almost negligible (a couple of RAF squadrons and some army/naval special forces): the South West Pacific Area (command) under MacArthur, during 1942, was almost 100% Australian; New Zealand was the second string in Nimitz's command, the Pacific Ocean Areas (command) and; in the Aleutians campaign it was all US and Canadian forces. Use of British Commonwealth in such cases, or at the global level, conveys two false impressions: that the ``British`` were somehow involved at all times in all theatres and that the ``British Commonwealth`` was a primary military/political organisation, when the forces of a particular Dominion were very often alone in joint commands with the U.S. Therefore ``Allies`` and ``Allied`` make more sense and are more accurate than ``British Commonwealth`` or any of the anachronistic alternatives.  |  `  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

The thing is, I'm an admin on a different wiki, and another admin on the same wiki posted a question to the rest of the admins asking if there was a URL that can be used to show any user their current number of edits on the wiki. On our wiki, there's a page called Special:Editcount that conveys that information (I don't think Wikipedia has a page like this though), so another admin advised him to use this URL: http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/Username. That URL would achieve the desired result, but one would have to constantly put the username of the specific user at the end of the URL when posting it on that user's talk page, so my goal was to come up with a way to avoid that; almost to create something you could post on any user's talk page without changing any part of it and still get the desired result. I came up with this: {{fullurl:Special:Editcount/{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}, this way, one could just post the coding on the talk page of the desired user and the returned URL would automatically direct the user to their respective edit count. This worked successfully for every other user whose talk page I tested the coding on (without saving the page, of course); the only problem is that the user he wanted to do this for has an ``*`` both at the beginning and the end of their username (the second asterisk isn't a problem, just the first), meaning that instead of being returned as:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENit gets returned as:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENand doesn't take anyone anywhere, because it's just the raw coding. So I was just wondering if you knew of any way to circumvent this problem (aside from just telling him to post ``http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/*User*`` on the user's talk page, which isn't the end of the world, but is, of course, what I was trying to get around in the first place), maybe by putting some other form of coding that I'm not aware of somewhere in the existing coding or something.

Photo selection: On 3/15/07, I trimmed his four photos down to what I felt was the most representative one, even though trimming them to zero makes more common sense.  What did I do to balance out this trimming?  In the external links section, I added a link to Shankbone's gallery in Wiki Commons, which features all four pics.  Hence anyone can see all four photos with the click of a button.  ``Chivalry is truly not dead,`` you say to yourselves.  (I even left the gallery/centered HTML around it, so that it'd be positioned right in the center for all to see, not off to one side.)  What does Shankbone then do?  He adds his other three photos back, and slyly keeps the link which I had added to his pics at the Commons.  His reasoning is that ``One photograph in a gallery looks odd.``  He could have simply reverted to the prior version, but he looked over my changes and then only kept the one change that benefited him. He keeps talking about how he wants to compromise and work with other users, but every chance he gets, he puts himself above all other considerations and still refuses to cooperate. Why would he have even made the Commons gallery unless he understood that his photos were not main-article-worthy?  He made the Commons gallery in the first place since he correctly reasoned that that was a better location for them.  Now he has told me he will do his best to have me blocked from editing this article any further.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBack to what I previously brought up about him using this article for careerist purposes.  Why did he put his full name in the title of each of the .jpg files he uploaded?  (Roll your mouse over the photos, or attempt to download them to your hard drive, if you don't know what I'm talking about.)  That's unheard-of.  Unless, that is, he wants a lot of people to download them, and have his name conveniently attached in the file name, in case said downloaders ever want to contact the photographer and offer him $ to reprint them... NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHow can he get as many people as possible to download them?  By making them as racy as possible, of course.  The point is: He could have posted clothed pictures without his name in them.  Or racy pictures without his name in them.  Or clothed ones with his name in them.  None of those possibilities would have raised the serious ethical questions that have been voiced here by multiple users.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. Slant of article: Tara Subkoff is a professional actress. She designs (or designed, since IOC is apparently defunct) clothes on the side, though actually all she does is modify existing ones with the help of a partner.  Her entire varied, and usually quite daring, 13-year film career is reduced to this line of text: ``She has acted in over a dozen movies.`` (Technically, that counts as zero descriptive lines of her actual roles or of accolades she has received.)  However, one fashion show of hers, which took place over maybe a 2-hour span at most, is represented by around two thirds of the descriptive text in this article.  Does that seem right to anyone?  I'd like for even one Wikipedia user to lay out for me how this is correct.  Someone who had never previously heard of Subkoff would think that the U.S. media had some sort of frenzy over this one show she put on, and that her acting is so subpar as to deserve approximately 0.0 to 0.5 words per film role.  (And 100% of the two ``references`` that he hastily added to this article are about this one-time event.)  Shankbone has consistently and subtly altered the emphasis of this article towards proving his point of view, at the expense of doing Subkoff's career justice.  In science, an experiment is never undertaken with the intent of molding the results towards proving one pre-desired hypothesis.  Any scientist who does so is branded as a sham and generally stripped of his tenure/degree/etc.  This is known as the scientific method, and has been followed for centuries.  Wikipedia was designed to be laid out in a very cold and scientific manner, to dispense nothing other than actual facts about certain objects and entities.  It's not an arena for positing one's own spin on objects and entities.  If you don't like cold and non-biased data, then Wikipedia isn't the place for you.

I do know that ``pain phase`` is a better term for three reasons: 1) abdominal migraine isn't in the head, 2) the ``headache`` word is recursively overused, 3) ``-ache`` underdescribes the sensation, and, 4) ``pain`` is shorter.

I find the current ``Japanese grammar`` article very hard to grapple with. There seems to be a lot of detail in some places and then great big gaps in other ones. For example there are lots of examples about ``jibun`` and ``are/sore/kore`` but on the verbs it says very little relatively speaking, and there is lots of rather dense stuff about historical Japanese and ``sumite`` becoming ``sunde``, and the use of the names like ``renyoukei`` and ``kami ichidan doushi`` which actually don't mean very much - basically it has too much terminology. I was originally thinking of editing  Japanese grammar into what I thought would be a better form, but after a few trial edits and test questions I felt rather concerned about the response I would get, so I decided to avoid trouble by doing minor edits only on the Japanese grammar page and creating supplementary articles for the things I wanted to add. I would like to aim for simplicity and unity and focus in the supplementary articles. I hoped it would be a reasonable compromise, and here even you suggest splitting the Japanese grammar page, but if you object to the articles I have made I suggest detailing the problems rather than merging. Also I wonder why you thought of merging my pages, when the page Japanese language has a grammar section which is extremely bloated, and really does need to be merged into Japanese grammar. If you want to merge something, I would suggest the most in need of merging is the great mass of untamed and unfocused edits on Japanese language#Grammar rather than my modest pages which are fairly well-focused and form a valuable supplement to this page in my opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Annotated bibliography and references==NEWLINE_TOKENAnybody care to chime in with content for this section?

People have a tendency to mix up the terms convex and concave.  Damn whatever idiot decided to use such similar words for such an obscure concept.  Rather than attempt to determine which sources have more authority, I suggest we look at the actual definitions of the words.  All the sources agree that the Moon's orbit has no loops.  And the Wikipedia article Convex and concave polygons seems to imply that a circle without loops would be convex, rather than concave.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome of the sources describe it as convex/concave inwards vs. convex/concave outwards.  I think that distinction is nonsense.  Something is either convex or concave.  Convexity and concavity have no distinction with respect to inwards or outwards.

But, as you can see, CorpM has a very strong point of view. The Suburban Express story is about a 19 year old kid who attacked incumbent Greyhound, decreased fares, increased frequency, and decreased travel times and then weathered attacks based on regulatory capture, predatory pricing, and (not covered in any press) harrassment by the Chicago Transit Authority, which leased space to Greyhound. It is novel in that S.E. sidestepped economic regulation which was designed to ensure legacy carriers (greyhound, et al) a fair return on their investment but which had morphed into a system that supported inefficiency, high fares, and lousy service. Since you teach, I imagine you can appreciate the issues we have with students trying to get what they want, regardless of the agreement they have with us. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENe have battled all sorts of fraud during the course of our history - people making fake tickets, tons of bad checks, people passing their receipt out the bathroom window to a friend who then tells driver he is getting back on, and so forth.

Their actions have not impacted ridership, but they have frustrated my employees and I by trashing us online wherever they get the chance. My instincts tell me that the user who is most committed to injecting POV into the article was contacted by one of the haters, who works in PR for the university and has contacts in that world. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe supposed ``controversy`` is a mish-mash of different issues that the haters are promoting, all rolled into one: 1) we filed 100ish small claims suits in a short period of time. the number was unusual because we had about a 2 year backlog of debts to collect; 2) A subcontracted driver was rude to a student who does not speak english. He was promptly reprimanded and we sought to apologize to the passenger, but did not succeed in identifying her. A loudmouth narcissistic attention seeking student who was on the bus posted the story to facebook from the bus and spent every waking moment posting the story everywhere he could. 3) This led to a situation on Reddit where the loudmouth and his friends were trashing S.E. as best they could and the moderator started manipulating the conversation, by deleting comments made in support of S.E. That got out of hand and our attorney sent a demand letter to the moderator. The moderator then exploited free-speech bloggers and caused the BIG STORY to spread. Self-interest came into play - Reddit is owned by conde nast. Reddit benefits from awareness of reddit. Reddit can only exist if users are free to say whatever they want. Conde Nast also owns Ars Technica. Ars Technica wrote several blog posts about how horrible SE is for trying to suppress free speech on reddit. See how this works? Downstream lower-quality blogs regurgitated the free-speech story.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTwo of the haters, now armed with SOURCES, took to Wikipedia and transformed this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suburban_Express&oldid;=542659074 into a very skewed mess. Then the problem became recursive - bloggers mentioned wikipedia, which led readers to trash the wikipedia page even more. Wiki editors cited the articles that cited wikipedia and the list of blogs that had covered the matter grew and grew. Now, the haters assert that the body of trash-news justifies giving the trash significant weight in the article - to the point where the real story of the company is pushed out. You can see this in corpm's proposed edit. He wants to remove from the lede the fact that the company was started by a student, and other key facts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn any event, I applaud your efforts to move the article in a more academic direction, and I'm glad that someone with an econ background has arrived on-scene.

Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.NEWLINE_TOKEN:@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a ``|`` was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.NEWLINE_TOKEN:It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...   /  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap.

In common usage, ``RBI`` is used for either singular ``Run Batted In`` or plural ``Runs Batted In``. ``RBIs`` is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with ``at bat``  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: As for ``thorough treatment``, I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you're going, you're both going to get blocked. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Jargon overrides grammar.

Formal rigidity covers up the real content (wasn't that actually what the Pentagon Papers were about? Just wondering...)   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*I share your concern with the cohesiveness, the paragraph I embedded refers to the Vietnam War context when he was in charge and is intended to clear up what his profile is both at the specific moment and in general as a person, and don't intend to delete his ``medals``/merits from the article, but offer a critical and balanced approach in the argument (``completely different subject?``, well it is directly related to the matter), so the reader can get the whole picture.

A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides, not just based on the account of the exiles. Given that the political climate has just recently improved, I'm sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written.

As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity, I always thought she should have been more flexible. She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done. Not sure which National Assembly you mean.

In 1991 the first media reports about the three Free Advice Ladies began to appear. Why? Because, unbeknownst to the general public, Amy Alkon and her two colleagues Minnick and Johnson, had read the article in The New Yorker and figured they could make it appear to be their own original idea. Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence exists at The Official Free Advice Man Web-site.When the original Free Advice Man went back up to New York from Baltimore, where he was residing at the time, and confronted the three intellectual thieves, he asked them, without first divulging his own respective identity, where they had come up with the idea. Because they were not under the spotlight of a major mass media outlet they divulged the truth: ``...we read this article in The New Yorker and thought that this would be fun to do...``.

The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.NEWLINE_TOKENIn particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n.

I don't apologise to people with such motives, or who serve protect themselves. The project only risks degenerating when sysop is left in the hands of people who abuse it. I maintain that the block is a front, a pretext. If reviewing admins are failing to take time to determine that and recognise the integrity of my claim, instead of taking Fram's for granted, which is contrary to ``we're all equals on wiki``, then I will have no choice but to raise the matter elsewhere, such as RfC or ArbCom. This isn't about discipline, at my age I don't consider ``you can't login`` as anything like you suggest, because it's not like losing wages. It's the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don't intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they'll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I'm sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won't be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position – though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable ``bad faith`` conclusion.

187679407.0,"SDATA_3 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species.

266830155.0,"SDATA_3 :  `Scylla]]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSummary of ScyllaNEWLINE_TOKENScylla is supposed to be a beautiful nymph. A man called Glaucus fell in love with her. She didn’t like him and so ran away from him, effectively rejecting her. Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.NEWLINE_TOKENWhat makes it a Good Story?NEWLINE_TOKENThe story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3 Latin Words to Describe ScyllaNEWLINE_TOKENMalus-evilNEWLINE_TOKENMiser- wretched/sadNEWLINE_TOKENAliquid miri- something extraordinaryNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Insight that the Myth Affords Into The Ancient WorldNEWLINE_TOKENThis myth does not show us a lot about the ancient world as it is a myth and so does not show a representation of the real world then. It does show us however that Ovid believed strongly in superstition or that he was just an imaginative writer which is equally likely. We can get a glimpse of the colourful words which he uses to describe the dreadful transformation of Scylla.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Other===NEWLINE_TOKENIn a late Greek myth,Recorded in Eustathius' commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Ad Lycophron. it was said that Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAccording to John TzetzesTzetzes, Ad Lycophron 45. and Servius' commentary on the AeneidServius on Aeneid iii. 420. Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but Amphitrite turned her into a monster.

348232938.0,"SDATA_3 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN:: Thanks for your message. I have already spent far too much time on the issue, so that I shall not take any further action. J Milburn's argument is faulty: one cannot remove an image on the possibility of the events that may or may not take place in the future; the relevant question is whether my copyright statement is incorrect at the time being, and the answer to this is clearly in the negative (at least Milburn has not come up with a free image of Michael Foot, thereby showing that my copyright statement were invalid) so that the image must stay. I have argued, but to no avail, that when a free image turns up (there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now), that event renders my present copyright statement invalid, at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image. At present no law is violated, so that there is no reason why the image should be removed. But I have said this many times, and unless  takes a firm action, I am afraid that the image will be removed because someone has put his heart into removing it. From the legal perspective, the action by Milburn can be likened with putting an innocent person in prison on the suspicion that that person may break a law in future, which of course is what fascist states do as a matter a course. Milburn has incidentally put his heart into removing the image of Ebrahim Pourdavoud, even though there is no reason for doing so; the image has a perfectly valid copyright statement and there is no reason to believe that the person who has made it public might have unlawfully appropriated it. Above all, Pourdavoud is not a sexy celebrity whose photograph would be worth anything from the commercial perspective (he is also long dead - his daughter was in her eighties when I saw her for the last several years ago, so that there is also no one who would have any interest, commercial or otherwise, in keeping the photograph at issue from public domain).

I added the court-line pic (also used on the court line page), and I happen to know the colours are correct. The image is a little washed out, but not to the extent that it is meant to be portraying a the yellow/gold/orange scheme - It is actually pink! I made a note about this on the 1-11 talk page but maybe you didn't see it. Though the yellow scheme was probably the best known, as it was used on their first TriStar G-BAAA, they had three other funky schemes which were used across the rest of the fleet - green bands, pink bands (also used on the second L-1011), and purple bands. They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy!

The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidate's notable success, if any.NEWLINE_TOKENThe term was used as early as 2004, but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States, with its record-breaking fundraiser of November 5. The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Origin===NEWLINE_TOKENAccording to The Politico, the term was coined in 2007. The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th, Guy Fawkes Day. This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film, V for Vendetta, which depicted a modern-day fascist Parliament, overpowered by popular revolution that was led by ``V``, a Fawkes-like character.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented one-day online fundraiser in political history, bringing in over $4 million. On November 6, Ron Paul's campaign stated that in addition, the free media coverage after the event was worth well over $10 million.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged, since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system, but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government, so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous. Paul's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton clarified to the New York Times that Paul does not support blowing up government buildings: ``He wants to demolish things like the Department of Education . . . but we can do that very pea  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.

He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

('Punjab Chiefs' L.H.Griffin, 1909 Lahore, p215-7}. .NEWLINE_TOKENThe ancestors of the Janjuas Rajputs , the last dynasty of the Janjua Shahis, were mentioned by Albiruni..``as noble men of noble bearings...who always did what they said``. Al-Biruni, despite living under Sultan Mahmud's grace, praises the house of Jayapala Janjua (10th Century AD): ``We must say that in all their grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of doing that which is good and right, that they were men of noble sentiment and noble bearing.`` Kalhana (13th Century AD) writes of the Janjua Shahis: ``Where is the Shahi dynasty with its ministers, its kings, and its great grandeur? ... The very name of the splendor of Shahi kings has vanished. What is not seen in dream, what even our imagination cannot conceive, that dynasty accomplished with ease``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Tarikh-e-Alfi of the Ghorids (13th Century AD) mentions the rebellious behaviour of [1]Raja (Ajmal) Mal (est. d. 1230 AD) (son of Raja Dhrupat Dev of Mathura) towards the Delhi Sultanate. It records that a ``Rai Mal`` of the mountains between Lahore and Kabul excited a rebellion against them and intercepted communications between Lahore and Ghazni. There is still today remnants of an ancient fort in Malot, Chakwal which was initially built by the Shahis and later rebuilt by Raja Mal Janjua. It is also inscribed that the last Hindu Shahi emperor Raja Mal embraced Islam at this place. Raja Mal was also the first ruler to begin the mining of salt in the Salt Ranges of Kallar Kahar and in the Khewra Salt Mines of Punjab which is currently the world's second largest salt mine. Many prominent Muslim tribes of Potohar Plateau in Pakistan trace their lineage back to the Janjuas through the five princes of the House of Raja Mal Janjua (13th Century AD). The five princes were: Raja Bhir Raja Jodh (est. d. 1259 AD) (ancestor of Chakri/Bajwala / Darapur Janjuas) Raja Kala Raja Tanoli Raja Khakha Jodh and Bhir were born of a Gakhar Rani while Kala, Khakha and Tanoli were born of another Rajput Rani. ('Journal of Central Asia', Vol.XIII, no.1, 1990 p79). According to Lepel H. Griffin, in his famous book Chiefs and Families of note in the Punjab (Lahore, 1910, ii, p254) he writes that Raja Jodh and Raja Wir/Bhir (oldest sons of Rai Mal), ``divided the country, the Maloki Dhan, between them. Jodh took the Salt Range near about the Makrach and captured the town of Makshala from a colony of Brahmans...He changed its name to Makhiala and built there a fort and two tanks for rain water.

I suppose that basically, the horse was of greater benefit as a riding and harness animal by getting a little larger, adding either strength or speed or both, while bovines were a bit easier to handle if they got smaller.  Donkeys weren't ridden so much as they were used as pack animals, so humans would probably lack the motive to breed them taller, other than, arguably, jacks for siring mules.    But as for ``local``, horse domestication originates from the Ukranian steppes and spreads out from there, and if you want to get technical, the animal itself is native to steppe country in both Eurasia and North America.  So while various indigenous wild equines eventually scattered themselves about, the domesticated ones probably got bigger before they got ``local`` genes into them (and in Northern Europe, most of the obviously-landrace types actually rather small)  Just saying.  We don't start seeing stuff routinely over 15 hands until well into the late Middle ages if not later.

In this BBC article http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13568270 Bondeson complains ``A rise in schools of animal psychology in the 1930s was encouraged by the Nazis, and Hitler in particular, and their potential military use examined. But that's a million miles away from the press claims - which get taller by the day - that the Nazis had a legion of talking, machine-gun-toting hounds, on the point of being unleashed on the allies.`` At any rate, I'm not sure any of this article should be taken seriously until someone actually reads the book (the only source for the material) rather than second hand, apparent misreadings (according to Bondeson in the BBC article) by the likes of The Sun.

The evidence for his support of that industry are: (1) his or her activities on other web pages that are biased in favor of the pornography industry, (2) he or she had, prior to my alterations on the page, apparently cited a newspaper opinion piece that was written by Violet Blue, a self proclaimed ``professional sex educator, lecturer, podcaster, blogger, vlogger, porn/erotica reviewer and machine artist`` .  This source was only changed to an ``objective`` source: the more mainstream news company Reuters only after I complained on the Talk Page of the biased Violet Blue piece.  Yes, Horrowshow commendably changed that because it was a Wikipedia policy violation; however, it was only changed after I began my activities on the page.  There are other pieces of information, not just on Lubben's page, but on others that support the pornography industry, that Horrorshow apparently effectively controls.  And so I should not be blocked for being provoked in such a manner and being responded to arrogantly by Horrorshow, who simply threw some vague, irrelevant, and uncited L. Ron Hubbard quotation back at me, as though I was to make any sense of it.  Moreover, his or her responses on the supposed asymptomatic nature of herpes, whatever that might mean, was crass, as a link was simply provided to some ten-page-long article that apparently contains information which ``proves`` that herpes is asymptomatic, again, whatever that might mean.`  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

When is it appropriate to put an organization's wiki article into category Eco-terrorism? Do we need notable experts to say they are EC? Do we need courts to say EC? Do we look at FBI definition of EC and apply it liberally? Do we never put an org there? 2. When is it appropriate to place ArticleX in category 1 vs. CatArticleX in category 1? For instance, if category Eco-terrorism is appropriate for article SSCS, and if category Eco-terrorism is appropriate for category SSCS how do we determine which one to use?

Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  Forceofdarkness`  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.

I cannot help showing I was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted. Seen as I was the person making ALL the editing, it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable. I had already said sorry for the choice of words I've made throughout the debate but again it is as if no-one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue, with or without them. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, if the only party that was trying to defend the case was blocked and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question, but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable, well I'm sorry but I was doing my best all things considering. Even before I was blocked from Wikipedia, I did add in more reference, I read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes, however I am only one person and there is so much I could do before I can say, 'I done my fair share, can someone help me finish this?'. But clearly not. I really don't know Wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do, but considering I have made many pages and edited many more in the short time I have started using Wikipedia properly, I can say that I have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this. My point with this is that even though I have made massive contributions on here, there are things I do not know, and how to get pages back on Wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them. So if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on Wikipedia the way I have, a page before on Ryan Shamrock (fighter) was speedily deleted and then returned back on here, but not by me, and up until just today, no-one has affected that. The user who is suggesting it has also recommended 10 other pages for deletion, however, the user clearly doesn't know the fighters he wants deleted, as 7 of them are/have competed in either a major MMA promotion or a second tier promotion. As he is doing such pointless acts, I still wonder why he's able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things I've done? Here is the link for this debate - Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ryan Shamrock (fighter).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI get what you do mean when you say that it isn't about Shark Fights or Ring of Combat when it comes to this debate now, but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions, as well as a few other promotions on WP:MMANOT, should be. I find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion I've been helping with, that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it, yet it got deleted, whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK has a weekly chat show on Sky Sports 4, whilst showing their delayed timed events on Sky Sports 3, I bet those other promotions don't even get TV time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe head of Cage Rage UK never asked me to post those articles. I have always worked by myself to help them with their Wikipedia page, never even expecting a thank you because I like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them, which as many knows, Wikipedia is the place for that. If you type in UCMMA in the Facebook search bar, find the one with a picture of the words 'Cage' on the top, 'Rage' in the middle, and 'UK.com' at the bottom, then like their page, then keep looking for any posts from Carl Gale, as I keep mentioning to look on Wikipedia for UCMMA/Cage Rage UK information, fights at certain events etc. Look as far back as the 1st September 2011, you will clearly see that not only was UCMMA not part of it, they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their Facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it. However, I kept working on the Wikipedia pages, making contributions whenever possible leading up until their UCMMA 24 - Hands of War event.

Sorry. You and I are on opposite sides of the world. That was because Orangemike wants you to create a user name that conforms to WP:ROLE before you do any more communicating here, and he (mistakenly in my opinion) thinks it is a copyright violation to briefly host a link to a copyrighted document while a few people discuss it. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I don't have time to get involved with your case but my one reading of the article tells me that it needs to say something about the litigation - provided the sources reporting it are strong. If they do conform to Wikipedia:Reliable sources, don't expect to have all mention removed. The quality of the sources can be assessed by independent eyes at WP:RSN or maybe you could attract more independent eyes via a Wikipedia:Request for comment (you should follow that blue link if you don't already know about RFC) on the article's talk page. And the amount of space devoted to the litigation and criticism of it (and the language used) needs independent eyes (maybe at WP:NPOVN or at an RFC if you decide to go down that road).

I'll just wait that out. Regards,   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Anthony, a reproduction of a copyrighted article on a third party's website is a copyright violation. Our rules are quite clear: we don't link to copyright violations. Additionally: in this era of Photoshop, we do not consider a purported scan of any document as a reliable source, especially when there is potential conflict of interest involved.  | [[User talk:Orangemike|Talk  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

While they are not connected to ibn Abdul-Wahhab, Deobandis are not Salafists either; they are actually a form of Sufism and rooted in the Hanafi madhhab.  Salafis as a general rule are opposed to Sufism and are most often do not follow a madhhab or if they do follow the Hanbali.  I would recommend checking the article on Salafism and the associated links, as they're quite informative.    : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1

Some of Paul's so-called references seem to be little more than his borrowing of a turn of phrase.  In at least one case, a supposedly non-canonical source seems canonical to me.  Chronicles refers to a ``book of Samuel, the seer`` describing the deeds of King David.  Last I checked, there was a book in the bible accredited to Samuel, who was a seer, and that book was largely about the deeds of King David.  That got me wondering whether the book of Kings (like Chronicles and Samuel, usually published as two books in most modern bibles) records any of the other writings referenced in Chronicles.`  : EDATA_3",test,-1,-1
