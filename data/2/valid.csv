We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait.

Some supporters of Dom -> Rom reorganized later their theory, by including the points raised against its likeliness, by presenting the Ḍom as a cover-term for itinerant service-providing castes and the three group as originating in different areas within India, speaking different (albeit related) Indian languages, and probably leaving the Subcontinent at different times, taking different routes.

386778869.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I see this as an important issue that requires extreme caution. [I’m speaking generally as I haven’t had the time to try to analyze Yoyohooyo’s  specific assertions.] Of course the Massei report is biased. It’s trying to justify the court’s (prosecution) point of view. Whether or not it is deliberately MIS-leading is something we cannot prove or disprove. But by definition, it IS “leading”, i.e. it leads the reader to follow the judge’s reasoning. If the judge’s reasoning is incorrect (deliberately or not) or based on false assumptions, then the report is misleading. That would seem to be the reason for the policy on primary sources and in this case we have to follow not only the general guidance on primary sources, but the stricter rule: WP:BLP/Misuse of primary sources: Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person. That seems pretty cut-and-dried. Maybe the report can be used to confirm what the court concluded, but anything more than that (including details that the court believes to be ``facts`` in reaching its conclusion) would seem to be prohibited as they are ``assertions about a living person``.  Demanding other RS’s, which may not exist, as an alternative to the Massei report is not a valid argument for using a prohibited source. At the risk of climbing on a soapbox, I will add that’s the problem with this article. We want to provide accurate, reliably-sourced facts; but too few facts are indisputably known and I fear that many of the sources we might like to rely on have been less careful in their scrutiny of officially-provided ``facts`` (what the prosecution and court have allowed to be released) than we are trying to be here.

Someone put in metal I thought it was already there for a long time, it kept getting removed . after some careful thought (I was there) I studied music history from Johnny Dodds to ``hardcore punk`` , I looked it to it and it makes total sense. The complaint from one page is there was no source and it was tagged I think as as ``fact claim`` . I looked to see if there was a source there was , it got removed all of a sudden by 3 pages.

If you are interested, what the AVNOJ decision actually said was this: ``‘Decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership, on state administration over the property of absent persons, and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities’. Article 1 of the mentioned decision states precisely the status of ethnic Germans: ``To be transferred into state ownership on the day this Decision becomes effective: 1. All property of the German Reich and its citizens situated on the territory of Yugoslavia; 2. All property owned by persons of German nationality, with the exception of those Germans who were members of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan formations, or are citizens of a neutral country who displayed no animosity during enemy occupation; 3.

Very differnt definitions are applied to the term as shown in the sources. I also think that the history section should be removed. It lists Islamic groups as Islamist movements based on opinion and it has nothing to do with the term. I think that the history section should focus more on the evolution of the term. The different stages it went through, for example, the term was first used in french to just refer to Islam. Then the term disappeared. Then during the 1970s people began using that term to refer to what they refered to as 'political Islam.' Then Daniel Pipes popularized the usage of the term.

The more of that lost information that we can reconstruct, the more reliable our scientific hypotheses are likely to be.  ….  From the original complete assemblage of living organism, known as a ‘life assemblage” or biocenosis, many events occur that screen out certain organisms, leaving a much smaller death assemblage, or thanatocenosis.  The process of breakup and decay of organism immediately after death is known as necrolysis. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“After a death assemblage accumulates, many other factors operate on the hard parts to break them up and scatter them around, so an even smaller percentage ends up buried for future fossilization.  These processes occur after necrolysis and are known as biostratinomy.  These agents of destruction can be biological, mechanical, or chemical.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Biological agents are the most important factor in most environments, both marine and terrestrial.  Both predators and scavengers are very active in breaking up shells and bones ….  In summary, the key factor that prevents biological destruction is rapid burial.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor those organism that are not buried right away:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Mechanical agents of destruction such as wind, waves, and currents can be very important.  These processes are most effective in shallow waters, where both waves and storm have their highest energies.  … In summary, the shape, density, and thickness of the bone or shell are the most important factors in determining survival under mechanical transport [until burial].”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“After burial a variety of digenetic [chemical] changes in the rock can easily destroy shells.  … In summary, the original composition and the groundwater chemistry are the most important factors in determining whether digenetic changes are likely to alter or dissolve a fossil.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Taphonomic research has come a long way since the pioneering studies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Paleontologists can no longer afford to naively take the fossil record at face value, but must always keep in mind the taphonomic “noise” that may obscure the original biological ‘signal’.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLagerstatten:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“The processes outlined above account for most fossilization and what we know of the living organism is usually quite incomplete.  However, there are extraordinary fossil deposits around the world that preserve soft tissues and sometimes even skin texture and color patterns. … These are known as Lagerstatten (German for “mother lode”), and they have produced some of the most important fossils known.  … From all these examples, several general trends emerge.  The best fossilization occurs when there is rapid burial and anoxic conditions to prevent scavenging, no reworking currents and little or no digenetic alteration to destroy the fossils.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Museum of the Rockies here in Bozeman is the realm of paleontologist Jack Horner.  I have often heard Jack speak, pointing out that the dinosaurs of Montana were almost all killed and buried by catastrophic river floods near the shore of the inland sea that is now Eastern Montana, the Dakotas and related Canadian States.  The bones and the geology both acclaim to that.  Of course, these floods are considered local in extant.

490754357.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== On recent edits regarding English section ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have reverted some edits by Capnprep.  I'll address a few of his concerns:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4. I have changed the repeated phrasing ``Most auxiliaries`` / ``Most modals`` to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease do not revert any of these changes without first addressing and resolving these points here on the talk page.  `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

There is also such a thing as qualitative, that is spirit of the law, rather than letter of the law that you seem to be incapable of understanding.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::::As I stated, I reverted because I realized that I was in the 'Crucifixion in art' section and that my statement didn't wholly apply.  I reverted because there is important art scattered among Manga, and the movies and 30 minute toy commercials of Anime. If this had been the 'crucifixion' article I would have left my statement in.  Having said that, I will restate my objections to that particular image.  Sailor Moon, the Comic, is an important and potentially relevant piece of art.  It is the Wonder Woman of Japanese Manga;  it is liberating to girls in an otherwise oppressive culture.  Sailor Moon, the Cartoon, exists only to sell plastic make-up cases and moon wands to 8-12 year olds.  Art requires that the Artist had something to say.  If you found an identical image from the comic, and some source that said that Naoko Takeuchi had some reason for it being there, I would have little objection.

All those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams. Men have a dress code which is more relaxed: the loins must be covered from knee to waist. The rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as sexual objects.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTurkey, a predominantly Muslim country, has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places.

133035858.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== M-hmmmmmm....... ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be ``stricken down`` as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Ok, ``.com`` stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that ``.co.uk`` is explicitly UK, and that ``.com`` can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- ``Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.``NEWLINE_TOKEN    NEWLINE_TOKEN I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - ``American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- My point wasn't ``British are the only people that use British spelling.`` (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that ``The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English.``. If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- ``But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds`` NEWLINE_TOKENAgain, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like ``PAH-EHD-OH-FILE``, adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced ``PE-DOH-FILE``, which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision.

11845450.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::``Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/botanists by nationality lists a 4-4 vote, which is hardly a consensus to make the changes you did. Some of the categories you emptied have been around for six months at least, such as British botanists, so it wasn't just an anon (who was most likely  logged out, as the software is wont to do). Although I understand that you personally think nationality is unimportant, that is just your POV; for a high-school teacher in New Zealand or Brazil looking up homegrown botanists for the class to write about, that is quite relevant, and nearly impossible to find out without the subcategories. In any case, you're setting yourself against the hundreds of editors who have built Category:Nationalities by occupation and Category:People by nationality and their thousands of subcategories. Either botanists are fundamentally different from other kinds of people (which could be argued I suppose -) ), or all these other editors are mistaken, in which case you should convince them of their wrongness first before unilaterally emptying out the category. But given that Category:American actors alone has some 3,000 names, I don't think you're going to get much of a favorable hearing! If you want to argue that the botanists is still too small to be subdivided, that's plausible, but your argument seems to be that the category shouldn't be subdivided no matter how large it gets. Just as you expect other people to defer to your knowledge in matters arboreal, you should respect those who are more knowledgeable about information organization.  ``NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_2",dev,0

I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user () who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.NEWLINE_TOKEN:2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of ``no opinion``. This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.NEWLINE_TOKEN:3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If a poll doesn't reach a decision, the poll is treated as moot and the status quo is continued. I agree that the name ``Macedonian Slavs`` is inappropriate (and many of the arguments made against using it were blatantly POV). The problem is that right now we don't have a mechanism for ensuring that the name is decided objectively. I'll have a chat with the other admins to see if anything can be done in the short term (bear in mind that the naming committee is just a proposal, it's not been endorsed yet).   NEWLINE_TOKEN::: I would like you to know that I appreciate your active involvement in the Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs issue, because if it is left to polls to decide such delicate matters, Wikipedia would soon degenerate. The English Wikipedia, and its mirror sites are the most important generators of the Macedonian Slavs term on the net - , which is much unfortunate, because it makes the term more ``common`` than it actually is. There was a brief period of some ``Macedonian Slavs`` references in BBC or CNN's news articles (the first half of 2001), but they have withdrawn the term very soon. The naming committee is a good idea to resolve matters of this type, since the naming of the article itself is a specific NPOV question - the different POV's can hardly be ``described`` in it. I don't want to leave the impression that I'm trying to put a pressure on you, but please resolve this dispute in a reasonable period of time (that is, don't forget about it -)). Thanks again for your contributions.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Just remember that we need to figure out what is neutral, not what is objectively correct. A committee which ``votes`` on what is ``objectively correct`` will not get ``endorsed``. This is the kind of thing which probably cannot be decided by a committee. See Wikipedia:naming conflict.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I didn't say we should decide what is correct, merely what the common usage is. What I'm arguing against is the use of arguments such as ``they don't have a right to use this name``, which is what's been happening so far. BTW, the link you provided doesn't work - could you point me to the right place?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Sorry about the red link thing. I was using it as a ``forward reference``. That is, I made a comment referring to a policy page BEFORE writing that policy page.

The Government does not provide legal recognition or protection for freedom of religion, and it is severely restricted in practice. `` or the Iran article ``the Bahá'í Faith, Iran's largest religious minority,[193] is not officially recognized, and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran.

(I know, I knowsuch bad taste, ugh, but it's hard to not use these kinds of metaphors when talking about the subject.)  I can understand the concern, but let me tell you my experience about reading this marvelous article.  Moni, you really are courageous for taking this article on.  I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone's story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.  I don't think it's something you should concern yourself about, since I'm not sure there's much you could do to remedy the situation, anyway.  And I'm so sure that you should.  Hope this helps.

Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to ``self identify as a nazi``? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, ``This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!?

But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please?

505509542.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Accuracy of 'quarrel' quote ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAccording to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article ``I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger`` is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.`  : EDATA_2",dev,0

Now if his organization were called the ``White Arab-American Institute,`` then I could go along with hime sense he would be truthful, but all arabs are clearly not represented.

One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: ``They control our systems of information.`` and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to ``prove`` that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome haved to tried to argue their way out of that truth. Thought the gospels several times point fact. However scholars have noted two things about the theories, that Mary borne no other children: One there is a motivate behind such theories, to uphold a doctrine that arouse much later; the church teaching that Mary remained a virigin throught her life. Two, the theories themselves do not hold up to under scrutiny for example, one such theory suggests that the brothers in question were step brothers, sons of Joseph by a earlier marriage. This notion lacks substance for it would it would actually deny Jesus the legal right of inherit the kingship of David, another theory is, that were actually cousins of Jesus although the Greek scriptures use distinct words for brother, cousin, and relative. Thus scholar Frank E. Gableline calls these theological theories far fetched he concludes the most natural way to understand brother is that term refers to sons of Mary and Joseph they were brothers of Jesus on his mother’s side.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMatt. 13:53-56, Jerusalem Bible: “When Jesus had finished these parables he left the district; and, coming to his home town, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said, ‘Where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? This is the carpenter’s son, surely? Is not his mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers [Greek, a•del•phoi´] James and Joseph and Simon and Jude? His sisters [Greek, a•del•phai´], too, are they not all here with us?’” (On the basis of this text, would you conclude that Jesus was Mary’s only child or that she had other sons as well as daughters?)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967, Vol. IX, p. 337) admits regarding the Greek words a•del•phoi´ and a•del•phai´, used at Matthew 13:55, 56, that these “have the meaning of full blood brother and sister in the Greek-speaking world of the Evangelist’s time and would naturally be taken by his Greek reader in this sense. Toward the end of the 4th century (c. 380) Helvidius in a work now lost pressed this fact in order to attribute to Mary other children besides Jesus so as to make her a model for mothers of larger families. St. Jerome, motivated by the Church’s traditional faith in Mary’s perpetual virginity, wrote a tract against Helvidius (A.D. 383) in which he developed an explanation . . . that is still in vogue among Catholic scholars.”NEWLINE_TOKENMark 3:31-35, JB: “His mother and brothers now arrived and, standing outside, sent in a message asking for him. A crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him, ‘Your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you’. He replied, ‘Who are my mother and my brothers?’ And looking round at those sitting in a circle about him, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers. Anyone who does the will of God, that person is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Here a clear distinction is drawn between Jesus’ natural brothers and his spiritual brothers, his disciples. No one claims that the reference to Jesus’ mother means anything different from what it says. Is it consistent, then, to reason that his natural brothers were not that but were perhaps cousins? When what is meant is not brothers but relatives, a different Greek word [syg•ge•non´] is used, as at Luke 21:16.)    : EDATA_2",dev,0

I do know it needed editing, revising, expanding, and to be ``brought up to the times.`` Just something interesting to think about.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENALLAH, the Arabic name used by Moslems of all nationalities for the one true God. It is compounded of al, the definite article, and ilah, meaning a god.  The same word is found in Hebrew and Aramaic as well as in ancient Arabic (Sabaean).  The meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful; cf.  Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 82, and the Oxford Hebrew and English Lexicon, pp. 61 ff.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== 2002 ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA previous version of the ``Allah`` article included the following:NEWLINE_TOKEN``Allah`` was also the proper name for the pre-Islamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic Arabic tribes. The name and has no femminine or plural forms. Allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods, such as the goddesses al-Lat? and Man'at?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnybody know why was this removed?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. It appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man (Robert Mory) in the last 10 years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWell, insofar as 'Allah' doubles as the name 'God' in Arabic we're up against the problem solved in English by capitalization, capital G for the monotheistic god of the Jews and Christians (who prefers that we NOT use his first name) versus the gods with a small G. ``Allah`` was undoubtedly used about all SORTS of deities, and that's where the Moon-deity argument falls down.  And watch out about publishing the female-trinity bit  isn't that what got Salman Rushdie in trouble? Michael Tinkler.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI authored the paragraph about the moon-god theory. I read about this in ``Islam``  by Jamal J. Elias, a Muslim author. The book is an intorduction to Islam from the POV of a liberal Muslim scholar. As Elias is Associate Professor of Religion at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and he writes on this theory as if it were fact, it seems there is more to this picture than the ``poor`` work of one scholar. Therefore, I have restored the paragrah, with a note on it's contoversy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI also authored the bit about Yahweh that was taken out. Critism accepeted, it belongs in its own article. So i have put it in Yahweh.  -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt does seem true that Allah was the name of a moon god - and that Mohammed's father had allah as part of his name. But the name does have a feminine form - al Lat. It is not clear the connection of the moon god to the Muslim god.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOk, first of all: Allah does simply mean ``the god``, rather equivalent to our capitalized ``God``. Hence, any major god (like this moon god, apparently) would have very likely been called ``God``. I did some [admittely Internet-based] research on this topic just now, and clarified a few things in the actual text. Let me know how it reads now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere's a question. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, so its articles should be about topics, not words per se. So is the ``Allah`` article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the Islamic concept of God? My initial thought would be yes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut Arabic-speaking Christians would use the word to refer to the Christian God. Does that complicate the issue? Maybe. But one might argue that the wikipedia is in English (this one at least), and in English the word ``Allah`` is generally used to refer to God specifically with reference to Islam. Right? So the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be under ``Allah``. Does this make sense? Anyone disagree?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnother question - Do Muslims take Allah to be the personal name for God or just the Arabic language word meaning God.

I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called ``Murder Machine`` and it was referenced at the bottom under ``References``, but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be ``busybodies``) as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia's syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced ``welder``, save for I'm sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven't been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I've read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can't stand things which don't come up in google counts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of ``authoritative`` sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a ``school of thought`` on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything ``so they say``.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENX-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki's undoing.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating ``duty-cycle``) to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a 'shortness' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.

However, there's no reason in principle why each can't have an article  as long as there is sufficient distinctive, reliably sourced material in each to merit that. This appears to be the case here, just about (though bloating the Lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful).

Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

You do, however, speak of Nepalese languages, and this is one of them. For example, Nepalese linguistics (2003, Linguistic Society of Nepal) speaks of ``Nepalese Languages`` but of ``Nepali`` as the national language; A Foundation in Nepali Grammar (Manders, 2007) presents ``Nepali`` in the context of other ``Nepalese`` languages; Language Contact and Contact Languages (Siemund & Kintana, 2008) discusses the influence ``Nepali`` has had on other ``Nepalese`` languages; Language Planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden (Baldauf, 2000) does the same. There is a strong tendency to use ``Nepali`` for the national language and ``Nepalese`` for languages of Nepal in general; NSL is one of those Nepalese languages, because it certainly is not Nepali. —   `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

It is a major component of identity, far more than say LGBT or political party. Anyway, the reason why I was compelled to ask the question is that I read an article about her new book regarding Revelations in the New Yorker and it was very anti-Christian. I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed. It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship. So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article. So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage, I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral. Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto. This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with. It might sound mundane but if I had all the information that I needed then I would have been able to make the decision to purchase the book. So instead of Wikipedia, I had to read the reviews on Amazon. Ergo, Wiki did not provide all the relevant info I needed. Thanks!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_2",dev,0

This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband's wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated ``beat`` as ``separate``, as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIbn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush).

The word ``fact`` in such a context no longer has any useful meaning because every rumour or piece of speculation that gets reported has to be treated as factual information. So if newspaper 1 reports something that is directly contradicted by newspaper 2 then both are reporting ``facts`` - the mind boggles! My complaint is that you are imposing changes on everyone else involved without any discussion of them and then defending them simply by saying you have a source. Of course we could all do this, but you know as well as I do that the result would be a chaotic mess - more or less what we are getting with this article. It was made clear when protection was turned down that the discussion page was to be used before making changes - you only like to discuss after the event because you know your changes are going to be challenged.

Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and ``Ariana`` for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines ``Ariana Airlines``.  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:NEWLINE_TOKEN:::1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of ``Iran Vij`` which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as ``Aria`` in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with ``Aryan`` and others picked it up.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called ``Ariana``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called ``Ariana`` or ``Aryana``.  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the ``official afghanis website says so`` you only show how weak your argument is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan``  well, that is not good enough.

Bell's theorem puts a big hole in hidden variable theories (stating that no local hidden variable theory can exist). One would have to make a serious jump to non-local hidden variable theories in order to have ANY hidden variable theory. Am I right in saying that there's no evidence or theoretical proof that says information can move faster than the speed of light? How could one even consider hidden variable theories without making that jump to assume information can move faster than the speed of light? Even if the speed of light is beatable, how would we prove it? The bias in the physics section is leaning towards is determinism because it says hidden variable theories could happen, it doesn't mention Bell's theorem, AND it makes a terrible counter-argument to hidden variable theories using that number genorator nonsense. As Gibbzmann said, this seems to put hidden variable deterministic theories on par with indeterministic theories by having Bell's theorem absent. Determinism and hidden variable theories may make people happy, but Bell's theorem says otherwise on the topic of local hidden variable theories.

That itself is a POV. I disagree and say that the reporters and anchors who reported the story were well aware that this was a joke and that debunking it was simply part of the satire. ``Debunking`` a time traveler is POV. And if it is satire it is clearly intentional unreliability. Reporting what something appears to be is a pseudoscience. Every year many news sources have ``Special Issues`` on April 1st. There is an understanding that on that date many pranks may be pulled. We laugh and then forget the jokes the next day, in my opinion. Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds`` broadcast is notable because (amongst other things) of the widespread panic that it caused by people who literally believed it to be a reliable news item. I don't think that any of these people ``went along with the fun, wink wink, nudge nudge, and fled their homes just for the snicker bragging rights``. No such notable hysteria came of this story, as I had already shown that since the initial flash in the pan 2 months ago this has been mentioned only once by any news source. Charlie Chaplin's The Circus is not the point, it never has been. The point is seeing how far a joke can be stretched for the snickering fun of it. The Circus, or a few seconds from an extra feature on its DVD over 80 years after it was made, its itself arbitrary to the joke itself.

Great, in 20 years have they supplied any of this hydrino product to coating manufacturing?`` If I understand correctly, Mills did not publicize hydrino hydrides until spring of 2004. That is less than 9 years ago. Also, consider that in addition to this discovery, they are also touting the more recent solid-fuel hydrino reactor as well as the CIHT fuel cell. Before all that was the discovery of plasma based systems. It is easy to see why this might 20 years or more to develop.NEWLINE_TOKEN:``Or more simply have they done an experiment where they recover the water from their experiments that allegedly recover energy from water and keep using that water and notice as the build up hydrinos increases the ability of the water to supply energy declines?`` They do not try to reform the water after taking the hydrogen out of it. In the CIHT cell design, once the hydrogen is used, the oxygen is incorporated in other oxygen species which serve various functions in the fuel cell. The ability for the water to supply energy declines the moment that energy is extracted from them, rendering them as ``non water``. There are no indications in the paper that recombination of two hydrinos with one atom of oxygen will form ``water``, or that further energy would be extracted by catalytic reaction of such ``water``, nor is any importance placed upon trying to measure the amount of such ``water`` as a separate item from normal H20. The interest here, primarily, is not the notion of ``recycling water`` for further extraction of energy, but rather, the interest here is to allow the electron of hydrogen atoms to fall to lower fractional orbitals below ground state and allow that energy to be harness through an electrochemical fuel cell via absorption of energy by ions.'—Expert Sectioneer of Wikipedia86 = 19+9+14 + karma = 19+9+14 +  NEWLINE_TOKEN:``My objection to the characterization of Rowan as an a source of independent research on BLP theories was at least partially based on this issue.

Has BLP ever done' an experiment which proved that they could distinguish between water with hydrinos and water that doesn't have hydrinos?`` To my knowledge, Mills has not made it clear that two hydrinos could combine with an oxygen atom, and this is perhaps because the nature of them would be rather unclear at this time, thus not justifying and publication of claims regarding that issue. Any questions specifically about this probably have no solid answers at this time, so it would not be surprising if no information could be gathered that Rowan scientists asking these sorts of questions, because that would probably not be available until the questions have good answers.

I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that ``he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation``... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section ``Media figure and business interests.``  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.

If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Agree, Superman is not a common nickname for him.

Olga said afterwards that ``she understood no Russian.`` Then, in a letter to Mordvinov, she writes:``Curiously, she seems to understand Russian.`` She said ``She understood no English``. Then Bella Cohen writes in her article in NY Times that she spoke in English to the invalid, and she answered back in English. Olga said: ``My nieces knew no German``. And we have copy of a post card written by Tatiana already in 1909 showing good knowledge of German. We have schoolbooks from Anastasia showing that she took serious lessons in German. Olga said, I knew I was looking at a stranger. But in Berlin, she said: ``I believe in my heart that she is Anastasia``, something she also repeated to Bella Cohen. She said: ``We showed her photos, and she did not react.`` Bella Cohen writes about how AA recognized Shura in a photo where Shura's face was hidden by a bell. Olga ``left Berlin with all hope extinguished.`` The very same day she writes her mother's secretary saying: ``How shall I tell Mama, this will kill her.`` (``Mama`` would have been devastated by knowing her grandchild was alive, that would mean that the others had perished.) And she tells Frau Rathlef about how she would like to help ``the little one``, but has no money. Gilliard calls her ``La Grande Duchesse`` in front of Dr. Rudnev, and afterwords said that the woman in Berlin had ``nothing in common with the Grand Duchess apart from the color of the eyes.`` And that is after his own wife has shown him the congenital bilateral hallux valgus, the scars on the shoulder and the finger. And according to Shura, she had the same hair color ``with the same wave``. Clearly these two were lying, their own writings tell us that. , Olga wrote to the unknown woman after the visit: ``You are no longer alone, and we shall not abandon you.`` ``Longing to see you.`` ``I remember when we were together.`` Would she write this to a total stranger? Would she give her personal photo album to FS? I don't think so. And don't forget that Frau Rathlef sent her manuscript to Olga for verification, and got it back with the words that the description of the time in Berlin was ``quite corret.``NEWLINE_TOKENChatNoirNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_2",dev,1

You seek to raise the IGNORANCE of manufacturers of folk and rock instruments to a virtue, to a new musicological convention. The centuries-old academic convention that obviously predates rock musicians maintains that a pair of strings is termed a course and instruments with courses are named for their number of COURSES. You ``convention`` you mention that contradicts this is nothing more than ignorance you wish to dress up as something more. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTell me, Andrew Alder (church drummer and rhythm guitarist who has never in his life played an actual ``ten-string guitar``), if you notate music for a coursed instrument, do you write 12 or 10 separate lines in tablature? NO. You write one per course, which is in practical musical effect one string. If you write it in musical notation (can you even read this??? I doubt highly), would you use numbered circles up to 10 or 12 for each so-called individual string? NO! You would notate the first two strings as a circled number 1, the second pair of strigns as a circled 2, the 5th and 6th strings as a circled number 3, etc. These instruments are COURSED! For all practical purposes these instruments are NOT ``ten-string guitars`` (with the hypen) a term that has come to signify a specific instrument, an instument you are obscuring and confusing by introducing misinformative garbage. You deserve no less than uncivility. I wil let you play at being a musicologist for a few weeks/months until I have the time to undo your work. So play ahead.

So that is what I did and proposed the image to be deleted (because it was not going to be in use). The only other image I proposed to be deleted was the wrong logo of a proposed bid. It was never my intention to edit war, but again GB fan felt otherwise to revert everything I did even when I left valid explanations. I was frustrated at the time and over the past two months have cooled down and am ready to return to the project.   `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

The Great powers page talks about past superpowers and it would be much better suited there that way the same thing is not talked about in the same articles. And what is with you with the Spanish Empire? The French Empire at it's height was just as powerful as the Spanish empire so why isn't it listed? It meet all of the criteria for being a ``Superpower`` but it is not here because there are too many former superpowers and listing just a select few is POV, that is why the Great powers page exists, to talk about past and present Great powers/``Superpowers``. The Spanish empire is not listed on the great powers page so why don't you add it instead of trying to add it to this page where it does not belong?

135062283.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN* Past tense. (Apologies in advance for any typos - bad keyboard and limited time - also, I'll try to put across a coherent argument without letting emotions get in the way, but I am really angry about this (for reasons I'll explain later)) It is incorrect English to say that events happening over a 22 year span all happened at once (i.e. in the present). For example, to say that ``EastEnders begins`` is incorrect. EastEnders began. In 1985. The article as it is at the moment (in present tense) reads like EastEnders is a film - with a set end, which we know it is not - it keeps running. It is my strong belief that events that happened in the past in something that runs in real time should also be written in real time (i.e. past tense for things that hapened in the past) - an argument that I have seen all three editors above use at different times. One of the reasons I am angry about this is that certain editors seem to have such a disregard for our language and the way it should be written, that they are willing to forget all about grammar and write this article (which, in my opinion, and as stated by Gungadin elsewhere) is harder to read than it was before, in past tense - just to get this article to FA status - how glory-seeking is that!? Don't get me wrong, it'd be great for this article to get to FA status, but to totally forget about good grammar just because the policy pushers (may I add that WP:TENSE is a guideline, not a policy) say that it needs to be in present tense juts takes the biscuit. WP:TENSE was obviously decided without taking into account real time series - something myself and Elonka have raised on various talk pages to try and change this, but as soon as I have gone away it seems everyone has changed their minds and are happy to have this article written in bad, hard to read English, just to get it to FA status. I say we should have it in readable tense - past - and screw tha FA status. If the voters can't see this is better in past tense, at least we all know it is deserving of FA status anyway - AND readable. -'''''' `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion ``the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary`` DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say.

I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them.

I'm ashamed to say I've never been to Bradford City Hall, even though I wrote the article on it.  I'd love to go.  I did speak to a local journo who said that it was OK to take photos in there, though.  (Some town halls are a bit weird about photos; no-one has told them about panoramafreiheit.)  Anyway, what I could do for you is to phone Bradford Council tomorrow and if I'm lucky I'll get some bored employee who would just love to leave their desk and look at the windows.  People never look at anything, and you can bet your life someone is working beneath your window day in, day out, and hasn't noticed it.  If I forget, keep reminding me until I do it.  It would be a fun job to go and photograph it.  I need to do a winter photo of Bradford Industrial Museum, anyway - you can't see the jolly thing for trees in summer.  NEWLINE_TOKEN: Update: I rang Bradford City Hall, and they had not heard of any such memorial window.  Someone kindly investigated for me, and they rang back today and said that it's a mistake, and there is no architectural feature such as a memorial window dedicated to this lady.  There is a movable installation within the building, incorporating a display dedicated to her and to other local heroes.  I'm told that this is in a public place and that I can visit it.  I shall photograph that for you when I can - hopefully during the next couple of weeks - but I'm sorry there is no window to photograph. I guess that there is a slight possibility that there may be a memorial window in a church somewhere, and that could explain the error, but I don't know how to investigate that.

Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of ``Russian torsion field weapons`` and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on ``The Philadelphia Experiment`` and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the ``saucers`` really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper ``On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics``. pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in ``this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics`` to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005`  : EDATA_2",dev,0

One might count the Ptolemies as the Thirty-second Dynasty, but I don't know if any reliable sources do so. They're either called ``the Ptolemaic dynasty`` or ``the Ptolemies`` or ``the Lagides``.

The article continues to push the POV suggestion that she is indeed a philosopher, which is an opinion only supported by her and her followers. There is only one professor in all of academia that supports the idea that she is a philosopher, and thus the article is pushing an extreme minority view as the truth. We are essentially doing the complete opposite of what we are supposed to do with psuedoscience articles in an article about psuedophilosophy. The NPOV warning will remain on this article until we truly resolve this dispute.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few suggestions for what we should do with this article:NEWLINE_TOKEN*Change the infobox to Template:Infobox WriterNEWLINE_TOKEN*Remove all POV claims that she is a philosopher; replace them with something along the lines of ``Rand claimed to be a philosopher.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*Do not refer to Objectivism as a philosophy; a term such as ``ideology`` would be more neutral.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Remove categories that refer to her as a philosopher.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, I'd like to point out this line from the article:NEWLINE_TOKEN:Rand viewed herself primarily as a novelist, not a philosopher   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENResponse to SuggestionsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are too many conceptual difficulties with LGagnon's suggestions. Again, we need good grounding, not unsourced opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo begin. The distinction between philosophy proper and pseudo-philosophy requires a fleshing out of criteria. Don't conflate Anglo-American analytic philosophy with the ubiquitous  belief-system development that preceded it. Or you can scrub virtually all Continental systems (endless varieties of Existentialism(s))from the category (of philosophy).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn fact, the analytic of North America is merely a method for doing philosophy. It eschews systems as such, due to the influence of empiricist/positivist skepticism going all the way back to David Hume. (Recall Hume awakened Kant  at least so Kant relayed  from ``dogmatic slumber.`` Philosophy has not been the same since.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurther, though we speak of belief-systems, since the decline of the Middle ages, and the notorious rote of the Trivium/Quadrivium, these systems have been increasingly secular and secularized in knowledge and value emphases. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn that respect, Objectivism is no less than its equally original, equally American conceptual cousin: pragmatism. Indeed, LGagnon's very student-musings about the exact status of Objectivism in this regard remind one of the reception pragmatism suffered (and suffers still) by comparison to earlier Theocentric philosophic systems. William James famously claimed that the very first real lecture on philosophy that he ever attended was the one he himself taught.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENErgo, ``ideology`` would not be a neutral mode of reference with regard to Objectivism anyway. That loads the controversial ``Objectivism-as-cult`` smack into the supposedly neutral explication of the system. It utterly distorts the sourcing and external material that is required by Wikipedia. It loads original opinion/research of the most expansive sort. It fails to unpack the place of reason in the Randian corpus. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh incidentally, many, very many philosophers in the analytic school disdain the Continentalists as philosophers. They used to refer to them, when favourably disposed, as philosophes  a la that great Continental Trio of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu). Othertimes, analytics would dismiss your average Continentalist as a ``philosoher-manque.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAyn Rand did not consider herself primarily a novelist. She explicitly addressed the issue of the novelist-philosopher distinction and with characteristic disdain: sneering at what she perceived to be the implication that one ruled the other out. She could not have been more univocal on the symbiotic connection she saw between the two. This is very serious indeed. AOluwatoyin`  : EDATA_2",dev,1

Is the “In an exclusively US context” section a part of the article being discussed?   For, in this section I find the following very misleading statement: “In 1996, the term became widely known in the U.S. owing to a controversy over a decision by the Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language (or sociolect or ethnolect) of African American children attending school, and thereby to facilitate the teaching of standard English.[12] Thereafter, Ebonics seems to have become little more than an alternative term for African American Vernacular English, although one emphasizing its claimed African roots and independence from English, a term linked with the nationally discussed controversy over the decision by the Oakland School Board, and one avoided by most linguists.[13] “   I pose this question because I have just received a translation from the Romulus and Remus Linguistic Institute.   It appears there is an effort being made to cover–up some very, very inept and ersatz scholarship at Wikipedia encyclopedia by simply declaring my analysis of the Oakland Ebonics Controversy as something that pertains only to that article when in fact the words “For more details on this topic, see Oakland Ebonics controversy” , the words Oakland School Board (twice) and  ‘sociolect’, ‘ethnolect’ and ‘African American Vernacular English’ appear under the heading “In an exclusively US context”.    My analysis of the Oakland Ebonics controversy” was about  ‘Ebonics’ the langauage of limited English proficient (LEP) English language learners (ELL) of African ancestry in the OSUD African diaspora.   I maintain that when a counterfeiter puts the name ‘Rolex’ on a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch, this does not make a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch a genuine Rolex.  I likewise maintain that when ignorant white trash and dumb Negro Sheepdogs that nurse at the udder of white supremacits trash use the word Ebonics as a synonynm for and African American Vernacular English this does not make Ebonics an African American Vernacular of English.

Others seeing that as an insult is their right.  I could put ``HAILSATAN666`` as my username and i'm sure you'd probably say that's offensive too whereas I'd say that's kind of a religious motto and greeting.  What part of that (SATANLOVESGAYMEN) is ``offensive``?  If you don't like that or interpret it a different way, you're welcome to do so.  That is kind of one of the important aspects of Satanism.  The word ``Satan`` can go anywhere that ``GOD`` can and shouldn't have a different reaction and if it does... not my problem.  Your note and whole argument, and actions against me are outright fallacious and simply trying to use everything i say in a manipulative and out of context manner.  As with the Fred Phelps article, placing that particular addition to his wiki was showing counter resistance to his viewpoints of hate.  So yeah, I'll be sure to see about how i challenge this further.  You don't really belong on this site as an admin if you can't see what you're doing or at least should not be reviewing any article or addition having to do with religion and in particular Satanism.  Take your Satanic_panic elsewher.  Calling my views ``trolling`` is designed as an insult to my character and opinions and simply false.  I'm not here to necessarily go along with popular views nor be censored.  If I do something that is vandalism, yes i agree it does need to be corrected.  I did no such thing and maybe, maybe my reaction was a little overboard however yes i am new at making a lot of edits and never had such blatant and targeted censorship occur on here before.  What you did was outright biased censorship based on your lack of understanding of subjects that you obviously don't have any business of editing or should maybe check the legitimacy before hand.  What you're basically saying is my religious tenantshttp://thesatanictemple.com/about-us/tenets have no place on wikipedia such as `` The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own.``.  In my postings i did not make a single attack but rather placed factual additions with references.  Now you're obviously spearheading an aggressive attack trying to also go after my username i've been using for quite some time.    ``Disruptive``...  Really... because history and text about history isn't going to be a little disruptive.  If articles have mass bias, need mass overhaul, and so on and that qualifies as ``disruptive`` yes, i do plan on being disruptive.  However, i am learning a little more about how to use Wiki Syntax and the proper places to put arguments.  Yeah right, you're not being biased nor making an attack..... right.  Do you want to poke me in the right direction for further petition and complaint?  You'r basically having me admit i must be submissive to you who i obviously don't have much respect for and rightfully so based on your actions and displayed ignorance.

Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMethods:NEWLINE_TOKENPatients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENResults:NEWLINE_TOKENThe fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENConclusions:NEWLINE_TOKENThis study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKeywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesionsNEWLINE_TOKENIntroductionNEWLINE_TOKENMorgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFigure 1NEWLINE_TOKENMorgellons patient’s lower legs.

Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFigure 3NEWLINE_TOKENClose up of a leg lesion showing a twisted fiber just under the epidermis.

However, the Coptic descendent of twt (``image``) is ⲧⲟⲩⲱⲧ indicating that  would have been pronounced something like *tVˡwa:t (Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction, Loprieno, 1995; Die Nominalbildung Des Aegyptischen, Osing, 1976), where V is an undetermined vowel (one of e, a, or u in Tut's time). Likewise `nx (``living``) here is an active participle, probably perfective, so the reconstruction of this should be *ʕa:nəx, including the effect of posttonic vowel neutralization (Loprieno, 1995). As for ``jama:n``, Loprieno indicates that the change j > ʔ before an unstressed vowel began in the early Middle Kingdom. This suggests that jama:n was realized as ʔama:n by the time of Tutankhamun.

As the Wikipedia article plainly states (citing the New Grove article by Michael Finkelman), the cor anglais only came into existence ca. 1720, ``when a bulb bell was added to the oboe da caccia``. Sibyl Marcuse states that the name did not first start appearing in scores until ``around 1760``. This name was indeed drawn, according to Finkelman, from an older Germann term for the the flare-belled horns played by angels in paintings of the Middle Ages—doubtless shawms of all sorts—``engellisches Horn, meaning ``angelic horn``. There is a distinction to be made (as Finkelman does) between the emergence of the instrument called cor anglais, and the (German) term ``angelic horn``, loosely applied to shawms/oboes of all sorts. The French word taille (for what it is worth) is cognate with English ``tall``, and is applied to viols (tenor viola da gamba), violins (tenor violin, or viola). The taille des hautbois'' was known in England as ``tenor hoboy``, and Purcell scored for it in 1690, a good thirty years before the invention of the cor anglais, and seventy years before the name first appears in musical scores. To claim that it is ``essentially the same`` as the cor anglais is equivalent to saying the tenor lute is ``essentially the same`` as a guitar.—  `  : EDATA_2",dev,0

I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27  : EDATA_2",dev,0

Her facial muscles struggle to move as she clearly tries to resist, in vain, the advances of the man who begins tearing her clothes off. Soon afterwards, the man drops his own clothing and proceeds to insert his bare erect PENIS into her rectum without lubrication. After some struggle from the woman, she eventually concedes and gives in to the constrictions of the phallus, which by this point is starting to gather fecal matter along the course of its shaft.

As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, ``They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?`` In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: The beginning could say: ``Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: This is just a proposal off the top of my head and after reading what some of the other editors have said.

Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Star FactoryNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENAlla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and addedNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and ``Leila``.  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] ``Post-factory`` lifeNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] 2005—2006NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENAfter the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song ``Leila`` was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (``Я просто сразу от тебя уйду``) based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (``Хочешь, я тебе спою``)NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] 2007NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENIn the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts.

Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: .

My thought experiment has gotten you all fired up, it seems. -) NEWLINE_TOKENIn the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there.NEWLINE_TOKENNow, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? ===NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENBut does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give. NEWLINE_TOKENThis theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPoincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. NEWLINE_TOKENI think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. NEWLINE_TOKENPossibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  |    : EDATA_2",dev,1

Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1. The information given there is incorrect. I've checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here's an excerpt from McCrae & Hofstede's fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and laterNEWLINE_TOKENadulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), andNEWLINE_TOKENthat similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa,NEWLINE_TOKENTerracciano, & McCrae, 2001).``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMcCrae, R.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's ``likely true of most subordinated individuals`` that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research ``reinforces stereotypes`` does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn't change the facts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism.

204258202.0,"SDATA_2 :  `::::::First off, Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion, and Blume said he did interviews, so I'm assuming Miles didn't pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots. That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your ``proof`` of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own ``proof`` is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.
