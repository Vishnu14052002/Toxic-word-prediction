In general, contemporary interpretations of the ``IQ gap`` can be divided into three broad categories:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN# ``culture-only`` or ``environment-only`` interpretations that posit only non-genetic causes (e.g., socioeconomic inequality or minority culture membership) that differentially affect racial groups; andNEWLINE_TOKEN# ``partly genetic`` interpretations that posit an IQ gap between racial groups caused by approximately the same matrix of genetic and environmental forces that cause IQ differences among individuals of the same race.NEWLINE_TOKEN# ``insufficient data``: no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problem seems to be that #3 isn't an interpretation, but rather the lack of an interpretation or the inability to empirically distinguish between alternatives #1 and #2. I've been brainstorming for a simple fix, but I can't think of one. The best alternative I can think of is to remove #3 from the list and add a follow up sentence saying something like ``a large minority think there is insufficient data and no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence``. This isn't as nice because more experts chose #3 than #1 in the S&R; survey.  `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

This term doesn't mean just the operations performed by one side (maybe you are changing Wikipedia encyclopedia with a military gazette?), but it addresses to a form of international conflict. Military intervention is ``Interference by a state in another’s affairs`` by military means. That means that both - the operations of the intervening powers and the domestic operations are intermingled. Anyway there are domestic reactions to the intervention. And you'll find no historic literature, that tries to separate them, because exactly this is the character of an intervention. Every singly source dealing with the military intervention in Yemen 2015 deals with both, the foreign intervention operation and the existing ground fightings of the domestic conflict. Still you did not provide a single source that claims, they do not belong together. It is your```` to treat them as separate topics and historic events. Greetings,  `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

I did want to talk to you though with regards to the stuff going with the Persians. I noticed some activity there and realized that someone has added Tajiks as 'Persians', which in effect negates the Tajiks page. Now the problem with this is the article on the Persians will turn into a massive article describing cultural variations and divergent histories etc. I'm not sure this is a good way to go. Tajiks are indeed Persians, but are as distinct as the Slovaks are from the Czechs or the Croats from Serbs (both groups speak mutually intelligible languages or basically the same language). In addition, as you well know, many, if not most, don't call themselves Persians anyway (most I've met refer to themselves as Afghans or will talk of their 'Aryan' lineage). The way we've set it up, on Iranian peoples was good in that we had Tajiks as a sub-type of Persians (which I believe you put in), and thus can have their own article as both a closely related type of Central Asian Persians and as an Iranian people with many distinct qualities of their own (linking them more to Persians in northeast Iran rather than those of western Iran), including the Tajiks of Tajikistan. In addition, most references distinguish between the two, while clarifying Tajiks as an Iranian people, usually referred to as Central Asian Persians. In short, after all this, I think it's a huge mistake to subsume the Tajiks given the weight of history and divergence that has taken place simply due to the vast geographic expanse and the Tajiks own unique qualities.

Also regarding ``tools`` I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.NEWLINE_TOKENThere are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the ``teaser`` entry for Crapsey.NEWLINE_TOKENThus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: ``we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!``NEWLINE_TOKEN3. Regarding your statement that it's ``actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,`` are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the ``offending contributor`` simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.NEWLINE_TOKENHave no idea what you mean by ``the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page.`` Can you point me to a sample of this?NEWLINE_TOKEN4. Regarding your statement that ``he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?NEWLINE_TOKENOr are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as ``malicious`` turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) NEWLINE_TOKEN5. On your reply to 3 above that ``Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' `` I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL ``license,`` which, from my understanding of the law, means ``with permission.`` The author still ``owns`` the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.NEWLINE_TOKEN6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you ``don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,`` this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other ``watchers`` like you (still don't know what your title is) know ``what's new`` on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?NEWLINE_TOKENAgain, thanks.

Of course, some people do not like either of these terms.  For example, some people prefer Benjamin's syndrome [], but that definitely sounds like a disease.  Andrea James has proposed the term ``interest in feminization`` for transsexual women who plan to transition.  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female, or desire to do so, including those who do so for non-traditional reasons.  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for non-traditional reasons, I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior.  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic, but I don't believe that it should be called a disease.  All said, I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject.  Given the recent replies to this comment, and the recent move debate, I feel like consensus has already been established.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, ``A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others.`` The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a ``rodeo cowboy`` to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Feral Dogs ==NEWLINE_TOKENSomething about what is said about feral dogs in the article doesn't match with observations on feral dogs. Actually it doesn't even match with some articles in wikipedia. E.G. the Dingo is a feral dog too and they are excellent hunters, as well as the Carolina Dogs, who even seem to have some unique hunting skills. It's also wrong to assume that feral dog packs lack the social structure of wolf packs, you should browse for ``Tuscany Dog Project`` (thats a study concerning this topic) and the dogs there, although not completely feral, have a very complex social structure in their pack (check the german version of wikipedia if you like, there's a full article). Also wolves don't form packs on general, in Italy and in Germany as well many packs only consist of the parents, their current litter, and the litter of the last year. In Italy, there are many solitary wolves and many who only live in pairs, as well as quite a few packs of feral and semi-feral dogs who can hunt prey wolves aren't capable of and who are competing or interacting with wolves (depends on the situation). So all in all feral dogs aren't that poor.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe dingo has had thousands of years to revert back to a semi-ativistic state. Domestic dogs havent had that amount of time to become fully fledged wild animals.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile domestic dogs do form packs, there is little monogamy, cooperative hunting, or mutual puppy care.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn all cases? If known cases of adoption, care for puppies by aunts (I admit, there is no prove for care by males), monogamy and cooperative hunting. As a matter of fact, these things aren't as common among wolves as most people think. Don't you think, you generalize to much?NEWLINE_TOKENE.G. Erik Zimen (a famous cynologist in Europe) witnessed no monogamy in his poodle group. Observations by Eberhard Trummler and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas came to different results (the first observed dingo/wolf/dog-mixes and the latter Sibirian Huskies), as well as Guenther Bloch in his studies in Italy (two groups and one pack of near-feral dogs, mostly or entirely mongrels). You should keep in mind, that there isn't much data concerning this topic and it wouldn't be the first time that an observer didn't really observe and just judged by what he/she already thought to be true. Remember, for a long time people thought, that wolves would generally form packs with an alpha on the top and an omega on the bottom of the pack or that dogs would always search the nearness of humans, because ``they are born that way``.

38714520.0,"SDATA_2 :  `My behavior, certainly as a newcomer to Wikipedia has never been destructive, nor am I a vandal. I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing ``edit warring`` which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and ``revert warriors`` who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the ``one-way`` pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being ``disruptive`` in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while ``revert warring`` without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as ``proof`` of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several ``reverts`` on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to ``revert war`` - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been ``revert warring`` for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and ``reverters`` who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the ``complaints`` about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to ``use`` him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.

It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting.

So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too.

That is just a nonsense.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet.

Educating the ``whole child`` - right - like anyone sets as their goal the education of half a child.  These are, to be sure, Waldorf buzz words - the kind of language Waldorf brochures are filled with - of course.  But they are meaningless in the framework of an encyclopedia article.  They are sensationalism.  They don't deserve mention at all - except in Waldorf brochures - and that's NOT what we are creating here.  And, really, there are lots and lots of examples in which the reality contradicts the ``surrounding the child with moral goodness`` you are describing.  The easiest to point to is that Waldorf teachers read Grimms fairy tales to the children and promote them to parents to read to their children.  These are the uneditied versions with the ``grimm`` stuff in them - the types of stories that are filled with immorality and horrible images for young children.  I can recite examples directly from them here but I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about - think Hansel and Gretel and all the immorality that goes on in that one.  These are definitely NOT themes of ``moral goodness`` - they are outrageous themes of depravity.  So again, what we have here is brochure language that, in this case, doesn't even reflect what goes on in Waldorf.  It needs to come out.  Setting up more sections and going into greater detail about each of the ``stated goals`` is a bunch of hooey as well.  Every school has fantastic goals for their students, just like every parent has wonderful goals for their child.  This article is NOT about the goals of the Waldorf Schools, it is about Waldorf education - what it actually is, what it actually does, what it actually means.  If you want to state goals and ideals, write yourself a brochure - this article is not the place for it.  Sorry.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

19876561.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:::When I say ``insecurity``, I mean as a result of the PRC's continued emphasis on ``liberating Taiwan`` and coupling the issue with the national psyche to the point where no one in Beijing today could afford to be seen as having ``lost Taiwan`` (the fact that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC not withstanding). Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II, with Mao even being quoted in the 30's as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan. Why Taiwan and not Mongolia? Well politics basically... the PRC's need to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union at the time and to drum up support against ``western imperialism`` and CKS's Taipei regime. CKS of course also recognized Mongolia in the 20's or 30's to try to woo Soviet support, but ``revoked it`` (ha ha) after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the Soviets anymore. Today CKS and Mao are long gone but the shadow of their vendettas still remain. - `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

I'm willing to work this thing out like mature adults if he is.  But the attitude of ``my way or the high way`` comes and it's going to go nowhere and probably end the same. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, I have to say I agree 100%  with your assessment of ``Currently the lede is too brief to do this job properly, which perhaps gives the impression that mentioning the detainee incident so prominently is giving undue focus to one particular event``.  That's exactly the impression I got.  I felt Tippx was trying to put too much emphasizes on something controversial partly b/c at the same time, he insisted a couple facts in the Early Life section were ``overwhelmingly positive`` as he stated. NEWLINE_TOKENBut forget the Early Life section for now. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLets talk about improving the Lede section because I agree it does need improving. It's just a bunch of short complete sentences. Which is why if you look at my edited version, I combined some to make it flow while also adding in diminutive additional facts but at the same time. I didn't make one fact override the other.  I listed basically the Key things about West's career and that was it. Nothing was more emphasized. And I actually, as you can see, came to agree that West's exit from the military did need to be mentioned but to a certain degree. While that is a Key thing in West's career, it's one of many. I listed he won this past election but also lost his first election; Listed after he retired, the jobs he took up before his first bid for election; And I did it all in chronological order.NEWLINE_TOKENFelt it was balanced, cited, and edited well. But ofcourse, the user reverted it and his only explanation was a different one ``sounded better``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut off of that, and onto how we can get it right...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, I'll be clear... It's legitimate and cogent, and I'm going to insert back, the fact that former Congressman Josiah Wall was the last black Florida Congressman and also the last EXACT YEAR is substituted for ``In November 2010 he was elected as the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since the 1870s.``. It's not that much more lengthy and listing the exact year and the last person, who indeed was the last black Rep from Florida, I feel does no harm and doesn't for a sec take a viewer completely out of the main subject. And also, justified to just say in the ``2010 Mid-term election`` rather than ``November 2010``. Everyone knows our elections are in November but when a reader 15 years from now may be reading, the fact it says mid-terms will immediately thwart the curiosity of whether this subject's election triumph was in a Presidential Election year or Mid-Term year.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd it also it's rational to just put he's ``Republican Representative-elect.....`` rather than `` ``He's Representative-elect from Florida.....`` and the ``He is a member of the Republican Party``. Those can EASILY and rationally be combined. No requisite for deliberation there.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs far as what   and   say about the interrogation incident. Qwurxian, your statement of ``you cannot factually state that it was due to pressure, that it was to preserve his benefits, because he was afraid of being convicted, or any other reason.....``...... I guess one would feel we need an exact statement from West's mouth as to EXACTLY WHY then OK, I guess find a statement by him saying WHY, but one would assume it was at least two if not all three of what you mentioned by simple coherence. We'll leave that open.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd we'll leave else to be be dealt with.

I'm still new at this and I simply didn't see them, although I certainly should have.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Anyway, your pictures of the Richards building are great!  Some of them, such as the full-height shots of the western service tower and the two towers flanking the main entrance, aren't available anywhere else as far as I know. The porch photos certainly help to illustrate the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor.  This collection of photos will benefit anyone who is studying what is generally considered to be Kahn's breakthrough work.  If you don't mind, I might make minor changes to some of the descriptions.  In particular, you correctly identified the two types of shafts in the photo taken from the garden on the south side, so I would remove the question marks from that description.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If you ever get a chance to visit the Olivetti-Underwood Factory building near Harrisburg, that would be great, especially since that article doesn't have any photos at all.  I suspect, however, that the building will be difficult to photograph.  The standard books on Kahn's work usually include a shot of one of its 72 mushroom-shaped (more-or-less) structural units while it was under construction, one of the entire building taken at an angle from an airplane, and one of the old entrance that was apparently at the northeast corner.  The old entrance seems to have been closed, so from the ground on the outside, options today seem to be limited.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::It still might be possible, however, to take a photo that gives viewers a feel for the size and shape of one of those 72 mushroom units, which would be very helpful.  When I follow the link in that article to the aerial photo of the building, I see that those units might be most visible and accessible from the west side, so perhaps a meaningful photo could be taken of the mushroom unit in the northwest corner of the building.  You would want to emphasize the west side of that mushroom unit, which has an indentation separating it from the next unit to the south, which should help to visualize its shape.  The north side of that mushroom has a triangular protrusion between it and the next mushroom to the east, which I suspect would obscure its shape.  Frankly, I'm not sure how well this will work from the ground, but it is worth a try.  Depending on the light, it might work better to try a similar photo of the mushroom unit on the northeast side of the building, where I think the old entrance used to be, again de-emphasizing the protruding triangle on the east side if possible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Also, perhaps there is a visitor's area in the entrance lobby where photos of the internal structure of that mushroom unit are permitted?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Good luck, and thanks again.

But I'll address the specific points you've made:NEWLINE_TOKEN:#While I didn't make the Mac Observer edit myself so I can't speak for the original editor, but I believe the point of the citation wasn't so much to make any particular point about the accuracy of Enderle's predictions (though I suppose that could be implied), but to point out how often Enderle has predicted Apple's failure, if not demise. Though more importantly, it illustrates that Enderle is target of criticism, deserved or otherwise. And I don't see how you could question the Death Knell Counter's credibility, when it links directly to cited articles. And I have no earthly idea why you quoted the policy on academic journals when we're talking about the validity of an internet site list (which itself is subject to scrutiny from the site's editors and readers).NEWLINE_TOKEN:#The operative term in the policy you quote is ``disproportionate``, which is to say, if an article's subject is subject of overwhelming criticism, than it makes sense for criticisms to dominate the article, and conversely, if the subject receives mostly praise, then it doesn't make sense for the article to be negative. But the way the article was before you erased the paragraph about the criticism seemed to be fairly balanced, with his accomplishments and prominence receiving the majority of coverage. And again, if he has his defenders/apologists, then feel free to cite them. Your edits aren't so much eliminating disproportionate criticisms, but whitewashing the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:#I do not beleive that WP:NPOV gives a particular editor the right to outsource their WP:NPOV responsibility to another editor. - you clearly misunderstand the policy and the reason for my edits. Criticism against Enderle exists. Those criticism against Enderle come from prominent sources. Again, accurate or not, criticism from notable sources should be in the article. That you referred to Gruber as ``a John Doe`` suggests that you don't know enough about him to make any judgment about his notability, and your characterizing Gruber's criticisms of Enderle as ``personal attacks`` tells me you didn't read the cited posts carefully. NEWLINE_TOKEN:# The Gruber and Death Knell citations were properly sourced. They, in turn, linked to specific Enderle quotes that they criticize. You might not disagree with what they wrote, but they are not libelous, which is what the biography policy attempts to avoid. The policy you cite doesn't apply here.   `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCamille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ``traditional`` values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ``respectable`` face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.`  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know).

The page has beeen previously reviewed by other users (check the article milistone) and they found it actually really aggreable and felt the need to specify the usefulness of the way it was 'prioritizied'.NEWLINE_TOKEN# For exampel in Europa Yearbook (a kind of printed version of CIA Factbook that is printed yearly).

From a wiki perspective it would seem that he's violated SELFCITE, a bit of SELFPROMO and certainly NPOV, however one could also consider his edits as a publication style. It's common for authors of reference books, particularly professors, to add footnotes after all and I find this to be a more plausible view. In my view, the way he is working over an entire article to achieve this is further evidence that, while it violates NPOV, he is not doing it maliciously as other self promoters do. His willingness to discuss puts him well above the bar of the usual self promoter. and he's not pushing his only publications as viable sources nor is he unwilling to seek consensus. From what I've seen of the usual self promoter there is usually a lot of histrionics, bluster, edit warring, ref spamming, talk page diatribes, etc I just don't see this here.     : EDATA_2",test,0,1

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Let me add that your ability to find POV errors, SlimVirgin, is not unlike NCdave's excellent skill. For example, when I first was asked how I thought of the page in the peer review or whatever they call it, I said it was OK. However, after I got to looking at NCdave's criticisms, and looked closer at the language and accuracy, I not only found 500-words, but like Dave, had to go above-and-beyond with additional comments. People like you and Dave (and Ruch Limbaugh) are my heroes for finding errors that are otherwise unnoticeable (and Wagon's not bad at this either, though his findings seem typically to sway more to the center or liberal left, in my opinion). Therefore, it is of high surprise that you couldn't find ``key issues,`` either yourself, or those we've identified. (A folder of 500-word essays awaits you.) Likewise, when Uncle Ed was my own role model and example on how to solve a dispute, a method I successfully copied to be the ``great negotiator`` and put out ``World War III`` at the en.WikiQuotes.org ``Abortion`` quotations weg page, it was likewise a surprise that Uncle Ed fancied himself the failure at negotiations, that had somewhat stalled: Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation#Well.3F, ``It has been 4 days since the last contribution to this Mediation. Is everyone giving up, or what? I didn't feel particularly good about putting a user block on FuelWagon, but does that change anything?`` Uncle Ed's only problems are having to deal with UNscreened employees (editor/writers), who are NOT paid employees (quality is ``you get what you pay for``) and, none of us (far as I know) are paid. CONCLUSION: You all are my role models, and brighter than you may appear, so scratch for answers -and have a good time off, while Uncle Ed takes a wiki vacation -probably to work at a ``real, paying`` job or rest up.

The layout and image choice in A appears to be better balanced than B, however as someone pointed out above, the image has not scaled well to the size displayed in the collapse boxes above so that needs to be improved. Correct balancing is important, and the oversized top aerial shot at the top of B unbalances the rest of that image. On the second choice, C is broadly a better picture. While it shows more of the structure itself, the image composition on D is way off - the skyline is inappropriately placed in the bottom third and because of its angle it gives the spires undue attention and creates a vast area of empty sky.

My hypothesis is that this will noticeably reduce unconstructive edits falling under the new user test category. Any support for my theory?  NEWLINE_TOKEN: Firstly I think it's a good thing that random tests can occur in main space. It rams home the fact that wikipedia can be edited by anyone. The only way for some people to believe this is to try it. Secondly, even after the header redesign for this page with the ``red flashing lights`` many people still don't notice it. But even after my disparigment I'm not against including a link to the sandbox somewhere more prominent, where do you suggest?  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I suggest with the Overview · Searching · Editing · Questions · Help part, the one under the 'Welcome to Wikipedia' box. With a brief explanation of what it's for in brackets, so new users know what it's for and don't get perplexed by what they see as yet another confusing feature of Wikipedia.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::At the moment, at 800x600 pixel resolution, there is no room for any more links in that area.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::OK...how about including it in either the navigation or the toolbox boxes on the left side of the window instead of on the Main Page?

OK maybe Kosova was part of an ancient Serbia a few hundred years back, but in recent times, it has never been a part of Serbia, as Noel Malcolm says in the source: Serbia occupied it, never liberated it because the majority were Albanian and they supported the Ottoman Empire, they never legally got the land, and after 1918 it went to YUGOSLAVIA as one of it's counties, like Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia and the rest of them. I can't be doing with these people who talkk off the top of their heads because they hear their friends saying things which they heard from someone else...Serbs deny the Srebrenica Massacre and the Holocaust which are well documented in reliable neutral sources around the whole world. Serbia is a rogue state, or it was with Milosevic, it destoryed Yugoslavia by invading all the other counties/regions: Slovenia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Croatia, Kosova; they comited countless atrocities and one by one, they were beaten by brave locals, and an international community of civilized states' armies.

265321143.0,"SDATA_2 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an effort to avoid any future edit war, I wanted to discuss why I feel that the lead should be changed. As I've noted previously, the citations given for rap metal repeat links sourced later in the article. The reason that punk rock had been given as a genre was because it was the most commonly used term given in articles about the band, rather than rap rock, a term that is not used by the band. While it has been argued that Rolling Stone is a stronger source than some of the others, it should be noted that these reviews were written, as previously noted, during the period in which the band was signed to a major label, when the band received more coverage than it has while recording and releasing albums independently, and sources agree that the majority of the band's works (its debut EP, debut album, and all independent releases) reflect a punk influence, rather than a metal influence, and most certainly the band's most recent work is considered to be punk-influenced. Thus, taking into consideration that the majority and most recent of the band's works is considered to be punk rock, I feel that this is the genre that should  be given in the lead.

The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that ``an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility``. If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles.

Structuring discussion of linguistic relativity around the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis on one hand and fictional languages on the other (with or without splitting) would be like structuring discussion of Special relativity around electrodyanmics on one hand and fictional space ships on the other. Yes, notions of linguistic relativity have been important in some sectors of speculative fiction, just as notions of faster-that-light travel have been in others. That does not mean that fiction plays a comparably important role in the philosophy of language nor in physics. As Maunus says, this article is, and ought to be, about the linguistic and philosophical treatment of various notions of linguistic relativity, not about their uptake in fiction, among creators of constructed languages, or in other creative applications.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::A history of scholarship on language and thought may or may not be useful.

It's also worth noting that this is the longest rename discussion I've ever seen at WP.  Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks the name of this article matters more than usual.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I may be missing some very notable exceptions, as I have not been involved in the dispute until now, but I see no unbiased editors.  I see editors who either support the concept of men's rights or feminists.  That is to say, without belaboring the topic, I see two diametrically opposed ways of viewing the world.  One way says men of every society in every corner of the world developed abusive and patriarchal social structures that oppressed women.  The other way says that gender roles evolved by men and women working together in accordance with biological imperatives like survival.  That these gender roles limited, benefited and oppressed both sexes in different ways by forcing them to conform to the roles that society dictated.  Feminist patriarchy theory has a fundamental need to attach male malice in the way gender relations evolved and inculcate guilt in modern-day males for the supposed sins of their male predecessors.  Tangential rant aside, if we can appreciate that there are two opposing sides here we can achieve a much better and balanced article.  But, instead, what we have on one side are a bunch of feminist editors, armed with all the sources that 30 of feminist dominated academia can churn out disingenuously feigning to be unbiased, disinterested editors who are merely trying to apply WP policy to produce the best article possible.  On the other side, we have the men's rights activists.  ``Men's Rights`` are, essentially, what men's rights activists say they are.  If the article, ``men's rights,`` doesn't have at least 50% of its content from sources that point to ``men rights activists`` (a term that I see used pretty pejoratively on the ``Men's Rights`` talk page) then the article is hopelessly biased.  All feminist sources regarding men's rights are, essentially, sources that respond to the arguments and/or actions of men's rights activists (male or female.)  To base more than 50% of the article on the feminist response to the article's topic is a poor way to write an article.  Such an article can easily occur here if we try to stick to the best WP:RS without including both sides (because we have failed to acknowledge that there are, in fact, two sides here,) as we will end up with an article that amounts to ``Men's Rights according to Feminists.``  The reason for which being that the men's rights activist source may be from some small publisher or self-published but the women's studies text will be published from Oxford Press.  `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

148448790.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== my editor review ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi István,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks so much for your thoughtful input to my editor review! Firstly, to answer the question you asked: I'm not sure yet if I really want to be an admin. Like I said, I've been toying with the idea, but I keep having these nagging doubts that it wouldn't be right for meI'd get carried away with my newfound powers, or I'd feel pressured by the responsibility that goes along with those powers, or I wouldn't have the time to be an effective admin anyway, or I'd spend so much of my wikitime admin-ing that I'd lose sight of actually writing and editing. So as I think of it now, mulling it over, I suppose I'm leaning against it. There is a certain ``prestige`` awarded those who are elected admins and that certainly had an attraction for methe satisfaction of earning the respect from my fellow editors, being entrusted with the special toolsbut that's no reason to seek adminship. Yeah...you and the nagging little voice in my head are probably right, adminship isn't my thing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegarding your criticisms: I know I'm naive, not to mention emotional to a fault. (as you know all too well!) There are a lot of things that should just slide right off my back but for whatever quirk in my personality, they don't. I've always been like this and probably always will beheightened emotional sensitivity is hardly a detriment to me as a musician/artist, but it definitely can get in the way sometimes in places like this. I'm learning to deal with it better, I think, just by getting more experience, but it's probably always going to be an issue for me to some extent. And to be completely fair to myself, I'm actually quite stable at the ``core of my being`` (to use a cheesy phrase) and there's very little in everyday life that can really hurt me deeply. (i.e. stuff waaaay more serious than dumb arguments on the wiki.) I haven't totally lost perspective! ;-) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour comments about my tendency to try desperately to find common ground with unreasonable editors were also spot-on; I certainly have done that but didn't quite consciously realize it until you pointed it out!! I hate the types who always go around making enemies and assuming the worst, and I always try to avoid being like that, the obvious result being that I often overcompensate and end up gullible and easily pushed-around: ``I'll say whatever you like, just please don't start a fight!!`` (I've done that most often with a certain Serbian fellow, for some reasonhoping to score brownie points and maybe win civil treatment eventually?!) Lousy foreign-policy strategy really...I'll try to do a better job of standing my ground in the future.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI must say though, I'm quite touched by the compliments section of your review: I guess my charming and atmosphere-improving qualities could be considered the good side of my diplomatic naivete? ;-) I'm glad to hear that my efforts are appreciatedespecially glad to hear it from you, since you are without a doubt another of those people who makes the Wiki not suck, and I value your opinion quite highly.

The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined, the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article. In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin(!).  ``That makes him more Polish than Chopin!``, ``If Sawoniuk isn't Polish, neither is Chopin``. I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this:  ``if he isn't Polish, neither is Chopin``, ``Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuk's father was a nationality other than Polish, Sawoniuk is purely Polish``. This is crazy, he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not. Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopin's name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator, he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk. . I asked him to provide sources:  and the reply was this:  no sources provided and more comparisons between F.Chopin and Sawoniuk. He also accused me that I am ``trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution``. I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin.

I noticed a page which I honestly felt (and still do) does not meet any of the 12 pts. in WP:MUSIC. I have no interest in their music or their entry. I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability. Last I heard, ``because WebHamster`` says so is not a reliable independent source that i am aware of, nor is that stated anywhere on in WP.

Female genital mutilation is by far the most commonly used term in Academic, Legal, Medical, and Non-Governmental circles, and thus conforms to WP:COMMONNAME. It has been suggested that the current name is an amicable compromise as per WP:NPOV, however this is not a proper implementation of that policy. WP:NPOV is not a trump-card for WP:COMMONNAME for use by those people who for one reason or another disagree with the wording of the most common name. Wikipedia in fact has a policy specifically for pages such as this, WP:POVTITLE, which has not been followed in this case (text included below). Lastly, to keep the current name is to give undue weight (WP:UNDUE) to the people who disagree with the term Female genital mutilation, we must remember that Wikipedia is about what is verifiable and sourced and not what one or more member's opinion on an issue is. There is no debate in the relevant literature over whether female circumcision is in fact mutilation, and Wikipedia should reflect the consensus achieved in verifiable and authoritative sources. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWP:POVTITLE: ``When a significant majority of English-language reliable sources all refer to the topic or subject of an article by a given name, Wikipedia should follow the sources and use that name as our article title (subject to the other naming criteria). Sometimes that common name will include non-neutral words that Wikipedia normally avoids (Examples include Boston Massacre, Rape of Belgium, and Teapot Dome scandal). In such cases, the commonality of the name overrides our desire to avoid passing judgment (see below). This is acceptable because the non-neutrality and judgment is that of the sources, and not that of Wikipedia editors. True neutrality means we do not impose our opinions over that of the sources, even when our opinion is that the name used by the sources is judgmental.``   `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

I have opted to reply to sentences as they appear.  My replies are in [green]. Sorry SD/WP.]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I don't know why  and  are spending their time arguing on your talk page. Neither Wayne or PresidentitstVB have submitted any strong reliable source that claims Punch wasn't a slave, sentenced to slavery, or wasn't enslaved.  [I agree that it is possible Punch could have been made ``subject to a superstition, passion, etc.,`` and thus, enslaved, according to the definition of the word at the time.  I have stated ad infinitim et nauseum that he was not in any way made a slave, when viewed through any lens of the time, no matter how many oxymoronic historians state otherwise.  Slaves were specifically identified by the edicts of 1618 (as ``slaves to the Colony``), by the slave traders and, most significantly, by the slaves themselves, especially those who converted to Christianity as slaves on board the early 17th C ships for the sole person of not being treated as slaves upon their arrival in the new world.  I'm tired of trying to argue the facts with a brick wall, except to ask you, , if I were to write what two other, reliable sources had considered in publications...  ``Scoobydunk is a brick wall,`` would you be able to find two reliable sources, which specifically stated, as if to state the obvious for no apparent reason, ``Scoobydunk is not a brick wall?``  I rest my case.]  They've also failed to provide any reliable source to claim there were slaves recognized and officially documented by a legal institution before Punch.  [Go ahead.  Do what  did at 5:36 PM (EST) on July 31st 2012, just make that leap of faith and write it!... (over and over again). [WP:OR]  After all, you have already said you removed it in response to my objections, so why should I be surprised, looking at the article's history, that you wouldn't continue the ``flip flip flam?``]. Wayne thinks this quote from Foner supports his argument but it doesn't because Foner is specifically talking about the institution of slavery and when historians consider the institution to have originated. I've already supplied a quote from a strong reliable source by Vaughan that further substantiates this point:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::``On the first pointthe status of blacks before the passage of the slave lawsthe issue is not whether some were free or some were slave. Almost everyone acknowledges the existence of both categories by the 1640s, if not from the beginning.`` Alden T. Vaughan. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 97, No. 3. July,1989.  [It is well known, , that slavery existed long before Punch's case - it was documented in Massachusetts (in present day Somerville, I think), in the Sugar Islands (the English colony of Barbados, primarily), from where a number of our first black immigrants emigrated, and most notably, on the slave ships departing West Africa, from where Punch himself is alleged to have come.]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::So, even though historians may differ on when the institution of slavery started, Vaughan clarifies that ``almost everyone`` recognizes the existence of both slaves and free blacks by 1640, if not, from the beginning of the colony. Wayne is trying to use his OR interpretation to pretend what Foner says contradicts what numerous historians have said about Punch, and it doesn't. He's failed to refute this fact and has repeatedly ignored this point made   : EDATA_2",test,0,0

59526265.0,"SDATA_2 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin  ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHistorian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).] NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

This article is one of many that I have edited, but since my ISP changes my IP address from time to time, it just seems I am only editing articles relating to Mr Ji's operations at the moment. I am sometimes incredibly dishonest, but my contributions to wikipedia have to be assessed not on the basis of my appalling crimes, rather, whether they make sense and are informative. I know very well the ex-premie sites are antagonistic towards Mr Ji and that nothing must ever be published that calls into question his good name and the multiple money-collecting organisations run in his name. This is an important piece of international law, with which every article in wikipedia must comply with as at present, under pain of persecution from the latter-day Praetorian Guard. Your contributions will be mercilessly deleted by a handful of premies whose spiritual path has led them to be the guardians of the premie-controlled pages in wikipedia. All I can say is to repeat something once said by a little known British leader some while ago, a man called Winston Churchill. He said: ``Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.

210814633.0,"SDATA_2 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::While the ``circle notation`` for benzene is popular in high school teaching, I have never seen a higher-level organic chemistry textbook that uses it, or met a practicing chemist who uses it. The ``Kekule notation`` seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and ``electron pushing`` much more straightforward. The circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation.   `  : EDATA_2",test,0,0

Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone.

''' NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Challenged content==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the ``Truly Smart Know-It-All``, an employee with ``a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular``, but who ``doesn't 'see' boundaries``, and the omniscient deity as a person who ``thinks nothing of imposing or intruding``. Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENPincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an ``outlandish prima donna``. She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENFor the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENLLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease post suggestions for rewrites below; if we cannot find consensus, it might be worth seeking a third opinion or an RfC.

279623291.0,"SDATA_2 :  ` is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the ``al'Buraq wall`` is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Yes, its a point of contention. See above, it is discussed both in the ``Lead`` subsection of the ``POV Issues`` section and in the ``Rashid Khalidi`` section.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Jordanian occupation 1948–1967==NEWLINE_TOKENI was wondering, from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of Al-Quds and the wall? and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation, while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty? I don't find this neutral? This should be changed.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:The answer is in the article.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources.   NEWLINE_TOKENJordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank. Which is under occupation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Jerusalem is viewed differently from the West Bank. See Positions on Jerusalem and Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan. This subject matter is so extensive and there are so many diverse ``postions`` on the subject, I am not really qualified to determine the correct descriptions. But for the sake of neutrality, I believe Yamanam does have a valid point. Even though the artricle on Jordan's rule calls it occupation, I suggest changing both to ``rule`` which would hopefuly solve the problem.   NEWLINE_TOKENYes i belive that could be an acceptable compromise. i would prefer it if you did it as edits by account members are more respectable.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKEN:I will.

How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRESOLUTION 162NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTHAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENa. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENb. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNo person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMotion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCan anybody say that  the wording:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENa.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENdoes not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?NEWLINE_TOKENClearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBrian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic.

I recently merged Smithy Gang into the list of chatacters by removing the non-notable characters, and I have asserted that a cameo section in the list of characters is valid, per Wikipedia:Trivia sections and Wikipedia:Handling trivia that uses Alex Trebek#Cameos as a good example. I have suggested that we rename the articles per Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves to something along the lines of Characters of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and World of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars or Mushroom Kingdom (Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars) just like Characters of Final Fantasy VIII and World of Final Fantasy VI or Gaia (Final Fantasy VII). I believe if these articles are to evolve beyond a non-notable list, they should be renamed. For example, List of Final Fantasy VII locations was merged into Gaia (Final Fantasy VII), because a World article is notable, but a simple list of locations is not. That is why there are other secions of the article to make it a World article.

Although it was actually Nintendo Power magazine, I do believe a magazine is a reliable source, and I gave a page from Next Generation Magazine which also said the same thing. In addition, I was surprized that TTN said that it was from the players guide, since he claims to own the players guide for the game. He has not verified this, since I asked him for citations in May, ``Could you look in the back of the Player's Guide and tell me what “types” of … Magic? I forgot what they call it in the game … well, anyways, what types of Special Attack or whatever it is (actually, could you find out what it's called?) there are? I remember some vaguely when I owned the guide like “Fire”, “Jump”, “Electricity?”, etc. Could you provide a citation, like the page number with a quote in context?`` TTN replied that he was going to ``get to it`` . TTN claims the player's guide is ``at the bottom of a box that's behind at least five others in a cramped space``.

I'm trying my best to not seem like just some person trying to cause controversy. I am just providing facts that I receive and hoping that they do not result in disputes. I don't see a reason why I should not provide reliable data when it is available so I will continue to do so. I'm glad that you have begun working on the article as many new editors are needed to make it more fresh. I know that some political sources (both gov. and oppostion) are hard to swallow. If you are commenting on my recent edit on ``millions of pro-government demonstrators``, I didn't originally read the source as I trusted that the source provided was just the government's statistics (which since it was the gov. POV, I made it seem so to readers). However, after a few reversions, I decided to take a look at the source to see what was going on. I found out that it was just a general phrase used by President Maduro. So that is why I made those changes from government sources. Other than that, I have been trying to provide stories from both sides (yes, I had to provide proof of me being neutral if you look above...) including the recent addition involving violent protests from HRW. I really try, but sometimes it isn't enough. It is alright though because like always, I just provide a boatload of sources to back up my additions if I need to.

BHT in this case is supposed to also block alcohol metabolism, so the person will stay drunk longer.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Another possible remedy is the consumption of motion-sickness medicine or over the counter allergy medicine.  Specifially, consuming cetirizine prior to consuming alcohol is reported to counter the hangover.NEWLINE_TOKEN====Supposed remedies====NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNote: Most of these have not been scientifically tested or reviewed in the above articles.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Water: this has been recommended scientifically. Hangovers are mainly dehydration; therefore drinking water before, during and after a drinking session will greatly decrease any hangover symptoms. A glass of water between each alcoholic drink is the best way to reduce hangover, as you won't easily become dehydrated; this also causes you to drink fewer alcoholic beverages. Drink as much water before sleeping as possible (within reason). It may not totally prevent a hangover but it will reduce headache. Continuing to drink water may help to alleviate symptoms more quickly.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Nux vomica (homeopathic remedy)NEWLINE_TOKEN* Milk ThistleNEWLINE_TOKEN* Angostura bitters and soda waterNEWLINE_TOKEN* DefecationNEWLINE_TOKEN* VomitingNEWLINE_TOKEN* Professional massage, reflexology (foot), and other detoxifying practices.NEWLINE_TOKEN* A glass of buttermilk. Though many people dislike buttermilk, it will calm down your stomach and add liquid to the body.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Having sex (or masturbation) may increase the release of endorphins, which in turn may help reduce the effect of a hangover.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages.  Caffeine increases the effectiveness of analgesics, and therefore may reduce headache severity when used with aspirin or similar medicines.  Coffee has also been shown in some studies to have a protective effect on the liver, effective in preventing alcoholic liver disease. (Caffeine is a diuretic, which would further dehydrate the body. This is generally not a recommended remedy. Thus, tea, especially green tea, is indicated.)NEWLINE_TOKEN* Nicotine, once again much like caffeine, increases the effectiveness of analgesics and its stimulant effects diminishes many hangover symptoms.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Cabbage leaves or tomato juiceNEWLINE_TOKEN* Bloody MaryNEWLINE_TOKEN* Michelada (popular in Mexico; one part tomato juice, one part beer, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi sauce or Soy sauce)NEWLINE_TOKEN* Mixing in a tall glass two raw eggs with pepper, Tabasco sauce, and gin. Although the cysteine in the egg yolk may have a mild benefit, the pepper, Tabasco, and gin will have a negative impact.  Colloquially known as a ``Prairie Oyster``.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Drinking more alcohol is scientifically proven (see hair of the dog), a well-liked remedy. This will, however, only delay the hangover NEWLINE_TOKEN* Eating seafood is a popular ``remedy`` in Chile.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Coca Cola or Pepsi-Cola, otherwise known as ``Black Aspirin`` (popular in Australia), also ``The Red Ambulance`` (South African); the caffeine, bubbles and sugar can be easier to hold down than pure water.  Moreover, the low pH helps the enzymes in the stomach and the sucrose partially compensates the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis. NEWLINE_TOKEN* Taking a shower and oscillating between extreme cold and hot temperatures.  This practice has no effect on the hangover and can be unhealthy. Seen in the movie The Princess Bride.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Eating canned asparagus before going to bed, purportedly a good cure thanks to the diuretic effects of asparagus.  Again, diuretics compound the problem.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Ginseng tea is given to relieve the effects of alcohol.

I just checked, and I noticed that Category:Historic districts in Massachusetts has the pipe character and then ``Districts`` after it, so it sorts into ``Districts`` when you're browsing by letter.  That means you have to go to the third or fourth page, or go to the ``D`` listings, to see the historic district subcategory.  That sort of makes sense, but it still doesn't get it listed on the first page.NEWLINE_TOKEN: The reason I created the subcategory for houses is because there are over 3400 entries in Category:National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts, which is absolutely huge.  I'm using Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory, so that'll organize them somewhat better.

The article is created, but as they have only ever appeared in one episode of a TV program where there part consisted of six words, the article is tagged with a CSD A7, another user removes the tag, the article is PROD-ed, on day 6.5 the PROD is removed the article goes to AfD, then five days later id deleted, because the actor fails the GNG and WP:ACTOR, the link turns red again. I would argue that Marshall's brothers and Carl the bartender may have appeared in enough episodes of HIMYM to get articles, but if HIMYM is all they have done then they fail the GNG. Given that day players are unlikely to ever bass the bar for GNG there is little point in redlinking every extra on HIMYM.

Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.``  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.``  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.``  The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.``  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.``  The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia's cons use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939.

In general, fuel becomes easier to reprocess over time, largely because less shielding is needed to protect against radiation from the decay of short-lived fission products.  One exception is the decay of Pu-241 (with a half-life of 14 years) to Am-241 (half-life 432 years).  Though the decay rate is much lower, the radiation hazard is higher because the decay includes a low-energy gamma ray.  Recycled fuel with higher Am-241 is therefore somewhat harder to handle safely.  Also, the Am-241 is not fissile and is therefore prone to absorb neutrons (in a standard light-water reactor) and produce higher transuranics rather than fission and produce energy and fission products, so the spent fuel is also harder to handle.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Fast reactors in principle can help reduce these problems, since most transuranics undergo fission in a fast neutron spectrum.  But fast reactors do not have a strong track record of reliability and carry a significant cost premium.  So in considering the economics of recycling, it's important to take into account not only the cost premium of the fuel but also the cost premium of the reactor needed to use the recycled fuel most effectively.     : EDATA_2",test,0,0
