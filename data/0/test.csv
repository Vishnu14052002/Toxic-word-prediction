As a direct result of these two points, European airbags are less powerful than their American counterparts and are therefore less likely to cause loss of life than those fitted to American cars.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGive me a break.  If you want to reintroduce this, please provide citations for every claim made in the paragraph.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgreed.  I've heard the exact opposite regarding airbag deployment strength, in factthat American-market cars have less forceful airbags because the occupants are more likely not to be wearing their seat belt, whereas in Europe the airbags can deploy faster (more forcefully) because it's assume you're wearing a seatbelt.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Dates of Deployment==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI take strong issue with the discussion of the dates of airbags first being used in vehicles, especially since it seems to me that it violates Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.  It seems to me that this article is American-car biased, a country whose automobile manufacturers are most assuredly not first when I think of those who were first-adopters of new safety technology.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENParticularly, the line about Chrysler making airbags ``standard equipment across its entire line in 1990`` makes it sound like Chrysler was the first manufacturer to standardize airbag installation.  The next paragraph indicates, however, that US cars produced after 1 April 1989 must have either airbags or automatic seat belts (latter is news to me)it seems to me that the vast majority of manufacturers opted to install airbags over seat belt systems.  However, the way the article is written, it seems like Chrysler's actions were unique and, most of all, done out of its own initiative, rather than being federally mandated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENQuite simply, Chrysler was neither the only company to take this step, nor did it have a choice in the matter.

To a first approximation, ignoring drag effects, if you take a siphon that is operating in vacuum and start lowering it into the atmosphere, the liquid in the tube above the lower reservoir will be in compression and without tension if its height above the surface of its reservoir is less than the barometric height at that ambient pressure. The liquid above the barometric height will be in tension. Thus a siphon at low pressures or an extremely tall siphon, could be operating with BOTH the chain model AND the atmospheric model at the same time!

This is because the recognition of a champion is in the hands of the organizing body. Here is a great example of the phenomenon I'm talking about: http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3033084.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, in reality no one can assert that Gaulish is an extinct language because we don't know enough about it before the Roman conquest and probably many 'Latin' words were already used by the Gauls before their first contact with the conquerers. At the most 'assimilation' could better describe what happened to that language. Both, the Proto-Italics and the Proto-Celts (Veneti) originally come from the Bell-Beaker culture and lived in a dialect continuum for a long time. In fact, Celtic is more a culture (brought by a Thraco-Cimmerian aristocracy) than a language family except for Brythonic and Gaelic languages which are both quite different from each other because of their respective substratum as mentionned above. Moreover, Proto-English (or Proto-Frisian) spoken by the Belgae was already used in Britain as well as in some parts of northern Gaul (Gallia Belgica) by the time of the Roman invasion, then the Belgic tribes just kept speaking the same language during and after the Roman time.     : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as ``WISconsiN TV`` (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the ``name recognition`` argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as ``Wisconsin TV`` deserves mention.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

328137384.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN::Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.    : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

37851061.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's unfortunate that the history of Sicily here at Wiki is the sole province of this one individual, ``Racial Reality,`` who is well-known amongst forum posters as being very biased against any research that shows admixture.  He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBlood group studies from the 1970's are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn general, you can measure the end-result of a person's genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by ``significant`` is ``statistically significant``, not that a large portion of Sicilians' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found ``African`` admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not ``problematic,`` as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and ``indels`` (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't ``refute`` or ``overrule`` the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study ``outdated`` or ``overruled`` or ``refuted``  all absolute drivel!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLastly, the person who wrote this...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Lastly, talk of races is all hogwash in any event...``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN...should be aware that the person made the steward of all things Sicilian, the above-mentioned Racial Reality, is a proponent of the existence of races...just look at his handle.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am a retired geneticist, and I do believe I have something valuable to contribute.

I sincerely believe that's what everyone is trying to do, but approaching it from different directions.  The ``Queen of Pop`` thing is not the biggest problem here.  There's a sentence in the article that describes Madonna as one of the most important people in the history of the world.  Really, that kind of overstatement does her a disservice.  She's made an incredible, unique contribution to pop music, culture etc but that's barely acknowledged in favor of a bunch of meaningless praise.  Can we please look at the entire article, and rather than give examples such as Bette Midler, which is not a particularly good article, please compare it to the various singers, actors, performers etc who are the subjects of featured articles.  There are numerous ``bad`` articles that we could use as a rationale for the development of the Madonna article but I would prefer to draw inspiration from the best articles rather than the mediocre.  There is some justification for the ``Divine Miss M`` reference.  She was actually known by that moniker early in her career as it was a character she created and for a time she was that character on and off-stage.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point.

About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours.

For verification of these facts, see ``Church History in the Fulness of Times,`` pg. 201. Pg. 183 of the same volume says Haun's Mill was a Mormon settlement established by Haun.

22455813.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `Hi PaulNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGiven your previous edits of this article I'm wary of your neutrality here, but here's what I think about thisNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe 'controversy' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called ``a controversial person`` and was much different than its current incarnation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe references to ``Oh Paula`` probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section areNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter wanting to ``bring down the president``, no matter the best interests of her client/advisee NEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissedNEWLINE_TOKEN- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her ``trailer trash``)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdditionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThough it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the ``trailer-park trash`` comment.

She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.

Re: when speakers do make arguments to defend a usage, these arguments are often complicated by their reliance on false ideas on linguistic matters, such as the impression that an expression is newer than it really is. The reference only provides one example: ``accepted to college``. As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on ``linguistic matters``? It is difficult to guess them solely from one example (that an expression is newer than it actually is).

The article on the Handley Page Victor states that it was retired nine years after the last Vulcan. Unfortunately, the Vulcan article does not give a last operational use date, although note should be taken that, according to the article, the last production Vulcans were delivered to the RAF in January 1965. Can someone clarify the dates and modify the dates in the relevant articles please? Vulcans and Victors must have been operational in 1982. If the Vulcans were retired immediately after the Falklands War (1982), Victors must have been operational until 1991.

It has been taken up with gusto by Lara Love, Cla68, and others. Now Kelly has embraced it. There has been an Rfc (started by members of the Intelligent Design Wikiproject) to get people to cease this bad-faith smearing, but it didn't get very far. The three most supported views were basically ``labels are bad`` ``waste of time`` and ``WP Not a Battelground``. all of which might indicate that labeling people and using any excuse to attack others with that label is bad, but the Rfc was a waste of time. I presume by now you've read my initial paragrah and the linked edits, and see taht my post had nothing to do with intelligent design; that I addressed two editors who had been warring, and Kelly chose to personalize the dispute - see reported by MastCell (Result: Declined because of lack of consensus)NEWLINE_TOKENspecifically where Mastcell states ``admin () already warned Kelly that he'd been edit-warring, and Kelly's response was defiant personalization of the dispute, concluding with the constructive phrase: ``If you would like to block me, bring it.```` and further where Tznkai states Kelly ``needs a wrist slapping`` for his/her response, and Carcharoth adds ``The ID cabal comments are grossly inappropriate``. Kelly was using ``IDCab`` accusations either through paranoia, or to game the system by personalizing the dispute in order to deflect attention from his/her edit warring.

NEWLINE_TOKEN1) I agree that we have two competing systems of measurement, and I don't mind them both being on the same page.  I guess we just have to decide which is the ``default`` (by which a monarch moves or is placed above/below a near neighbour).  Basically, I feel that if we had two dead monarchs whose reigns were VERY close to each other, but where the absolute days conflicted with years/days, we should have years/days override absolute days and perhaps include a footnote to draw attention to the overlap.  Anything else would appear like a mistake.  I've just checked, and so far, none of our close ties present too much of a conflict for now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) What to do when Bhumibol, Elizabeth, and Tuanku approach another monarch in table one.  My feeling is that these problems are unique, momentary events that resolve themselves:  once a monarch ``in motion`` (alive) passes a monarch ``in stasis`` (dead!), they move up the list.  The problem at stake (and this happens only a few times a year) is precisely WHEN to move them.  Since they don't move up automatically (one of us does it manually), we are bound to be inaccurate:  I'm in the Central time zone of North America, so WHEN exactly did Bhumibol surpass Victoria - his time zone, hers, mine - and if I change it in the evening versus the morning, what day does that constitute?

It should be linked to Wikipedia:Policy thinktank (that may be a category thing now...haven't proposed anything in ages).  It should be announced that it is available for discussion in as many public ways as you can think of (I'd say the village pump and the mailing list are best...probably WP:AN too).  Set a time (say, 1 month?) that is left for discussion only (that is, voting will not start until at least ).  Once discussion has reached some kind of consensus, establish a clear voting schedule (what possible votes may be cast  yes, no, neutral, for example  what each type of vote means in real terms, how long voting will last, who is eligible to vote, whether or not the question may be altered once votign is underway, etc.).  Alternatively, if discussion seems generally to favor the idea (but it's not clear that there's enough consensus to make it enforceable policy), it may simply linger as Wikipedia:Semi-policy, in other words, a principle that's a very good idea that a lot of people like, but which for one reason or another isn't fully policy.

The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling.

536952418.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKEN*Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the ``African slave trade`` (Davidson's book of that title is about the ``Atlantic Slave Trade``) and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an ``indigenous`` practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on ``African slave trade`` is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between ``African slave trade`` with both ``Slavery in Africa`` and ``Atlantic slave trade`` (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into ``Slavery in Africa`` or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on ``Emancipation movements in Africa`` or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then glossed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?   `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

But the opposite of ``brochure speak`` is ``antagonist speak``; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is ``weasel`` language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. ``  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - ``it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000``.

Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying ``rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important``?

Here's the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::#``According to Steiner, the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example,[4] so in Waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring, practically active adults to emulate. The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::And there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work.  I'm sorry if it is offensive to you as a Waldorf teacher, to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness.  In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.

It's not that Tieleman isn't an NDPer, but his credentials go beyond his NDP politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party, also.  I'm responding partly, also to this edit by  which accuses me of having a ``political agenda``...as if BCLib9045 didn't themselves, and as if I were an NDP supporter, which I'm decidedly not - e.g. [https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=35935973&postID;=5500307054343113661 in my posts on Tieleman's blog yesterday.  I'm an experienced Wikipedian and fully aware of Wiki principles like WP:COI and WP:NPOV and fair treatment of WP:RS and WP:VS; unlike BCLib9045 who shows no apparent regard for these, particularly WP:COI but also WP:3RR (there's been four times that ``NDP-affiliated`` has been re-added after either myself or  took it out (BCLib9045 is a SPA).  I've puzzled long and hard over my own real-world COI on BC political articles, but I see no reason to recuse myself from participation in BC political arti9cles, though generally I give them as wide a berth as possible; but when I recognize POV political activity/wording, as a responsible Wikipedian I can't not say something about it, or challenge the POVism - and COI/spin edits - when I see them.  My interest here is to prevent Wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine (of any party), and to make sure Wikipedia principles are observed - particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect Wikipedia guidelines or concepts like WP:NPOV.  In the case of this item about BC Rail, there's lots missing, including the search of the Clark-Marrissen home during the opening of the investigation (and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming, and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case).  But there's also lots of other commentators, particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated, but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like Sean Holman, Laila Yuile and BC Mary who have similarly spoken out about Clark's involvement in the BC Rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public, and of the ``informed media``.  She may have been out of teh way for the HST fracas, and the Big Media have pronounced her ``clean`` of that - but he Big Media also have maintained a veil of silence over BC Rail.  The current text says that she resigned for family reasons; but it's well-citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the BC Rail affair.  And about the Tieleman thing, unless every time Conservative-affiliated columnists or BC Liberal-affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims (often false), it's not fair to single out Tieleman for this; that's the reason for the cite tag; Tieleman's own byline says only ``Bill Tieleman is one of BC's best known communicators, political commentators and strategists. Bill writes a politics column Tuesdays in 24 Hours newspaper and The Tyee online magazine. Bill has been Communications Director in the B.C. Premier's Office and at the BC Federation of Labour. Bill owns West Star Communications, a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour, business, non-profits and government.``  And frankly, seeing whats going on with the NDP and teh things the Party Council/James supporter types have been calling him, he may not be ``NDP-affiliated`` much longer....  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

631098682.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  , 25 October 2014 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Ok, and after this here is now the detailled technical explanation and conclusive evidence for the UE categories and their achievable throughput: The calculation of the theoretical DL throughput in MBit/s according to the largest available carrier bandwidth of 20 MHz  is as follows: A 20 MHz carrier consists of 100 Ressource Blocks (RB). Each RB consists of 12 Subcarriers (SC), which can be divided into 2 time slots (TS) each that carry 7 ODFM-Symbols each. Further we have a QAM modulation scheme. The maximum QAM specified is 64QAM, which means there are 6 bits/symbol. Additionally we have 2x2 MIMO antenna technology which allows two parallel data layers (L). In total this results in: 100 RB * 12 SC * 2 TS * 7 ODFM-Symbols * 6 bit/Symbol * 2 L = 201,6 MBit/s (Absolute theoretical technical maximum DL data rate per 20 MHz carrier). [] (page 3).NEWLINE_TOKENNow let's take a look at the UE categories. This information derives from the specification document 3GPP TS 36.213 [] (page 25 to 34): Let's take a look at table 7.1.7.1-1:NEWLINE_TOKEN*Cat 4 Devices use coding scheme MCS28 for DL and MCS23 for UL. This leads to TBS Index 26 for DL and 21 for UL. Looking at table 7.1.7.2.1 we now look at N_PRB (# of Ressource Blocks) = 100 (corresponds to 20 MHz carrier). For the TCS indices above we find 75376 and 51024 respectively. This results in 51,024 MBit/s for the UL. For the downlink we have 2x2 MIMO, so there are 2 Layers. Corresponding to table 7.1.7.2.2: The available number of ressource blocks 75376 (SISO) translates to 149776 for 2x2 MIMO resulting in 149,776 MBit/s ~ 150 MBit/s. As can be seen this ist a bit less than the 2*75,376=150,752 MBit/s which are stated in the 3GPP UE table Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Cat 3 Devices use coding scheme MCS23 for DL and UL. So with the explanation above we find: 51024 resulting in 51,024 MBit/s for UL again and with 2x2 MIMO for DL 101,8 MBit/s or simply 2*51,024=102,048 MBit/s (Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306).NEWLINE_TOKENIf we now reduce the carrier block size to 10 MHz - what happens? The amount of ressource blocks reduces from 100 to 50 - that's all. The MCS coding scheme stays the same. The conclusion is that a Cat4 device is able to achieve a theoretical troughput of 73,712 MBit/s with 10 MHz (50 RB) (Tables 7.1.7.2.1 & 7.1.7.2.2) of spectrum. Subsequently a Cat3 device in contrast can only reach 50,024 MBit/s according to these two tables and not around 75 MBit/s as previously discussed. I hope this clarified the issue so far. I doubt, that the development group is wrong here in their own specification.   20:26  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months.

265761474.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `I'm concerned about how problems are being ``addressed`` here.  Jza84 summarized what this page is merely about (``merely about how the UK is subdivided``).  There are two problems  with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page.  First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no ``merely`` involved.  Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue.  Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution.  Jsa84 could learn from this attitude.  The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun.  This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom.  I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community.  Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused.

686216164.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe first issue here is use of use of the word ``revealed`` religion, which was completely well sourced, but you have reverted (and again, you have also done some massive modifications without any consensus at all), to show some two theories. Your whole argument is based on one sentence from one source, while I would provide several references below. But, before that, your one source does not even contradict it being a revelation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom your own one source:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPage 78: ``...Guru Gobind Singh's work is best understood as the fulfillment of Guru Nanak's revelation. The Sikh organization had taken on the semblance of a State during...``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo your own source is describing it as ``Guru Nanak's revelation``. Now, my addition was well-sourced, and I can add here tens of other sources. But, I believe, at this point, there is no need to even share them, since your own source agrees with revelation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNext, you keep quoting the sentence on ``not being Prophet, but illumined soul``. As per your own definition, ``Prophet is one who utters divinely inspired revelations, believed to have come from God``. In this sense, since your own source says revelations, it is completely fringe and weak to consider even the ``non-Prophet`` aspect as reliable. Especially when there are 10s of other reliable sources that also use the words ``revelations`` and ``Prophets``. And further, again, even in your own source, when describing ``Guru``, the author quotes:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``On account of his divine prerogative and attributes the Guru, though human in form, is godly in spirit. God speaks to humanity through him. God enlightens the seekers of truth through him and his word.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe author also states, ``Guru Gobind Singh tells Bhai Nand Lal .... (Guru is) the Light which is eternally God and represents God's Being in pure form. It is because of the consummate perfection, that God is in the Guru and the Guru is in God.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, I have not even brought it any of the other 10s of sources, and your own single source is so weak (and on the contrary, it actually supports ``revelations``, ``God is in the Guru`` ``God speaks to humanity through him``). As I had said before, it is you who needs to get consensus before your massive unexplained edits that you keep performing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd finally, as a general advice, the fact that Sikhs consider the Gurus to be direct messengers sent by God, and the Guru Granth Sahib to be the word of God, is one of the most  basic and fundamental beliefs in Sikhism.

I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine.

The letter is below:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel.

There is no proper arrangement as a ``faithful and discreet slave`` class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people.

These aren't even stubs IMO, except for stating that it's an episode of a series and which episode it is and which season it's from, these articles are largely blank. Someone expecting an article (or even a short stub) will probably be annoyed by articles like this.

The work to setup the article formatting is small in comparison to actually writing the content for all the sections listed.

I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it ``personal`` long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.

Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.

The thing is most of the media sources in India(often considered the criteria for WP:RS) neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any. A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media, and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated. The other day, content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length, except for announcing the winning coalition.  Nothing much(in fact nothing at all) is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance. At the moment, various Youtube channels and small-scale news agencies(that probably don't even own a website of their own) are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that I'am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia. Excluding this personality, There are several others more who are making significant popular impact, but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia. Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either. It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out, and worse still they are the first to sponsor/support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WP:RS every time. Thousands of other articles meanwhile, present heck loads of falsehood and bulls*it.

Has he written anything other than that work, in journals, or other peer reviewed publications about those specific years of history? So I concur with Vartan, and any neutral user can't do otherwise when De Waal has been used more than his notability would allow as sole source in countless articles. As he is a sole source, he can therefore be considered as having fringe position and removed unless Grandmaster or Atabek have any other works substantiating the personal opinions of De Waal who supports fringe positions in various issues including Shushi or the Armenian Genocide. The fact that he presents the Armenian Genocide as an Armenian position and compares it to a fabrication of the 60s of an alleged 2.5 million Azeri exterminated by Armenians alone would be enough to dismiss his position for that particular period of history. I'm afraid this time around, the adding of De Waal has reached the limit.

One is the choice of operating system; do you get a model which uses gas piston technology, or the more traditional direct impingement? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFans of the gas piston will state that impingement models are prone to jamming and often foul easily. Fans of the impingement model will call gas piston tech mechanically unsound. Who is correct, and what is the real difference between the model types here?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBasic AR Functionality – What makes an AR-15 an AR-15?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo qualify as an AR-15, a rifle must be self-loading, and be able to perform a specific set of basic functions mechanically, without user assistance. To be more specific when depressing the trigger, the rifle needs to fire a single cartridge, and then extract that spent case from the chamber and eject it in some manner. Next, it must then load an unspent cartridge into the chamber. The round is plucked from the magazine, the breech is then locked, and the hammer cocked. The rifle will then have a fresh round loaded, and again be ready to fire.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENDirect Impingement – How do the original AR-15 models work?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDirect Impingement is the original technology, devised by Eugene Stoner. Propellant gas is bled through a small hole located in the barrel, which is then channeled through a very small tube where it can proceed to directly contact (or impinge) the bolt carrier mechanism. At this point the gas is pushed to the rear of the rifle, and the spent case is extracted and ejected. It is then pushed forward by spring-loaded action, and strips an unspent round from the cartridge, loading it directly into the chamber of the barrel. Contrary to the statements of Gas Piston proponents we have put over 2000 rounds through rifles without cleaning and without malfunction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGas Piston Technology – How do the new piston technologies work?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGas piston technology was first used in modern firearms by Mikhail Kalashnikov on the AK-47. While similar at first blush to direct impingement systems, there are a few key differences in operation. The firing process again begins with propellant gases being bled into the barrel. However, instead of being forced into a tube as it is in a direct impingement system, it is contained in a separate cylinder. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis cylinder contains a piston(similar in operation to what you may find in an AK-47). The gas moves the piston, is in turn pushes the bolt carrier rearward to handle the extraction and ejection process, and then is moved pushed forward to the closed position by a spring just as with direct impingement.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENar-15NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhich system is better?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe direct impingement has proven itself through the years on the AR-15 platform and replacement parts are inexpensive, easy to obtain, and generally made to a set “mil-spec” standard.  Due to the hot gas from the fired cartridge being redirected into the action it will quickly heat up and become dirty requiring a cool down period before the bolt carrier can be removed from the rifle.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe action of a piston rifle remains cool and clean, even after shooting 100 rounds in rapid succession. The bolt carrier can be removed immediately and held in your hand without burning yourself. The trade off for the action staying cool and clean is that you will experience snappier recoil when shooting which makes the piston rifle a little less accurate, especially for follow up shots. Finally, piston system parts are not interchangeable between manufacturers due to there being no set standard and the use of proprietary pistons and bolt carriersNEWLINE_TOKEN    : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

Though these acounts vary, in general they portray Jesus as a 1st-century Jewish sage or prophet who had a following but who did not establish a religion or send his disciples to convert the gentiles. Scholars of the historical Jesus use the historical method and Israeli archeology to reconstruct a biography of Jesus. They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his. The so-called quest for the historical Jesus began with Hermann Samuel Reimarus and continues today with scholars such as the fellows of the Jesus Seminar.`` LC, I imagine that you will assert that this isn't what's meant by the term ``historical Jesus,`` but if you google ``historical Jesus was,`` you'll see that this is how the term is generally used.

We do have to decide whether there is a Chinese culture to describe.  We do have to decide whether there is a Chinese civilization to describe.  We do have to decide whether there is a Chinese nation (or perhaps 2) to describe.  And if all of these exist, and we discover that despite overlaps there are significant distinctions between them, we have to decide whether to try to jam them all into one article - a nearly impossible task as we've seen - or to put them in multiple articles.  And if we put them in multiple articles, we have to decide if one can be said to be the most common usage, and thus the page first reached for ``China``, or whether more than one are equally primary and thus, like America and Britain, the first page for ``China`` should be a disambiguation page.  As an American, the primary meaning of ``America`` is clear to me. But I have to face the reality that plenty of people around the world think differently, and some are even offended when we Americans call ourselves ``Americans``.  Those who think ``China`` always means one thing to all people need to face the reality that many reasonable people around the world seen clear distinctions between Chinese culture, Chinese civilization, and the political entities that use ``China`` in their names.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in those distinctions.  It points out the success of China as a civilization and culture.

23763522.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `. NEWLINE_TOKENWhy would Palpatine propagate his deformation by continuing to generate Force lightning? Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely ``warped`` all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, ``He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.`` When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, ``SUCKER!`` to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, if you look at the U.S. Constitution, both the Preamble and Article II repeatedly and consistently refer to ``the United States of America.``  From the surrounding wording, it is clear that the Founders were referring to a single legal entity and believed they were constituting such an entity.  So ``the United States of America`` is the legal name of the federal government.  There are also many sections in the United States Code which refer to ``the United States of America.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* They are referred to in both the Constitution and other documents as ``the United States`` because before 1787, they were semi-independent.  This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates.  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency, engaged in trade wars with each other, refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line, etc. into a ``Union`` hence how they became the ``United.``  Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the ``Articles of Confederation`` from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).  Your conceptualization of inter-state relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited.  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine. — NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI hold a bachelor's degree in history from the most prestigious public university in the United States.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI do not have all day to write on talk pages.  I did not think it was necessary to rehash the convoluted details of two centuries of American history just to explain how we got to our present pigpen of legal fictions and political realities.  But thanks for doing that for me.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen I said ``wording`` above, I was referring to the consistent use of the definite article, ``the,`` rather than the plural demonstrative adjective, ``these,`` in the Constitution.

87085629.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the things that bugs me about the writers who claim that the Midwest accent is the standard American accent is their fishbowl view. They view their own accent as the correct one. What do you think somebody from Georgia or Texas would think of that? Is this another ``to the victor goes the spoils`` from the Civil War? The north gets to have the ``correct`` accent? The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can attest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska twang? Hell no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is ``the bomb,`` but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled ``bahm.`` Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulate, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they hae no trace of the New England weirdness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worchester, forget it...very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people. Young kids in Vermont are not carrying this on at all. The old timers with their ``Pepperidge Faam Remembas`` accent with all the ``ayaah,`` well that was a Swedish accent and the grandchildren of the Swedes don't talk that way anymore. Not at all. As for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. As far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplants and no accent at all, except for the rednecks. And what can you do about the rednecks?  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

Althoug a magortiy of the episodes involve the police, and they conduct their own investiagtion, to wich Conan and Richard help (Conan useally solves them through). There are also the rare episodes in which Conan helps the police, and Richard is not there. This being said there are 3 other ``types`` of episodes that tend to happen (although not as much), that never involve the police. One type involves Conan and the children, in which Conan solves a mystery or focuses on Conan as a detective and his detective work(along with the Junoir Detective Legue helping him).

Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)NEWLINE_TOKEN 19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these ``newbies``, but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it ``An Unearthly Child``).  20:39, 9 January 2006NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::: I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::The CBC profile I think used ``Out of the Ashes``, which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  —  •  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is ``An Unearthly Child``. The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as ``An Unearthly Child`` is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.   •    : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

There are two options which can be taken to make this section NPOV. The article needs to be rewritten or expanded such that it accurately graps ALL of the Charter, with references not only to its policies towards Israel, but its social and economic policies and ambitions as well. Since the majority of Hamas' efforts are directed to domestic efforts and not terrorist activities, those aspects of its charter should not be shoved aside. The other option of course is to provide the link to the charter which can easily be read by anyone remotely interested in the document.

Artist known as ``unclassable``, its autobiographical works cause polemic. It is a photographer but almost never its photographs itself takes, it makes its life a work of art by using the others, and spaces it few days becomes a character of novel. Its most known series of photographs is that of the ``Blind men``. By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them ``artistic performance``. The public is often shocked by Calle's works. Along with primary shock and disapproval, morals are often mandated to be discarded in appreciating the innovating works of Sophie Calle.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJudging from its terrible grammar, syntax and diction (and use of ``its`` where ``her`` should be, for example), this seems to be a machine translation from an unreferenced French source.

694222698.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that. And if you DON'T agree that reliably reported quotes from the head of organizations are good enough sources for Wikipedia, then there's quite a lot that needs to be removed from this article. You can't have it both ways.     : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

While it is the job of the author to provide these references (lest the author would risk a deletion), the lack of verifiable sources should at least have been pointed out. I have done so in the meantime.

Unfortunately my university studies will get in the way of all the Champions League games, at least for the group stage as over here in Toronto they start at 2:45pm, where my classes are scheduled. You have it lucky in Itsly where you can watch it after work! Very upset about it but what are you gonna do. I could watch a re run of the game, but I can't quite ever get into it because I already know what happens, it's not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone. (I like shouting at the TV screen) You probably know the feeling hahaha. Highlights are he best bet, but I know it doesn't show the full story of the game. So I can't banter much, but what a game it would have been I'm sure. I talked to my brother about it though, who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it wasn't for Buffon, it would be a whole different story. I love to see Buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top 3 goalkeeper at least! This just goes to show that you can't doubt a team's Champions League performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league. As a true fan, you are always rough on your team, but always stay by them through thick and thin. As you've said, this should be a great confidence boost for Juve and can hopefully channel it towards Serie A and further CL games, as there is still a long way to go! Hopefully Juve can win the title for a 5th straight and prove to all the people that it's Roma or Inter's time for the Scudetto in their place haha!

278931584.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :   Plummer published in 1896. Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine. Given Plummer's age, I don't think a mention in Laurence's article about Plummer's belief is that pertient, although I am pretty sure it'll make its way into the Bede series of articles. On the canon law bit, I think the bit I've mentioned is enough to establish that it was irregular, but that opinions are divided. (Gotta love those Victorian scholars who just KNEW what was right (grins)). I guess my main problem with Plummer is that he's over a hundred years old. More modern scholars seem to think that reliance on canon law wasn't as important to the papacy and the chuech at this point in time. For Laurence the important points are that he was consecrated by his predecessor and that some folks may have felt this was irregular. Plummer seems to be more concerned with what Bede was doing and saying that what actually happened in Laurences time, I'd rather throw this information into the Historia article.  -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

That is why I support the idea of including ``Jewish`` at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to ``single out`` Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' ``early anouncements``,  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his ``extraordinarily reliable Agent D`` report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary ``contributors`` to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an ``interest`` on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

We have to decide which one has contributed more to Dragon Ball becoming known in the English-speaking world. In my opinion, it was the manga, since Dragon Ball has been known for a very long time thanks to it, and, in the US, the first broadcasts of the anime where unsuccessful while the manga was already a success, and I have the impression that it was this success with the manga that lead Funimation to keep on trying.

82179813.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  Of course there is no intellectual property here outside the GFDL license.  If you are unaccustomed to the term ‘intellectual property’, or afraid of it per se, if it strikes terror in your heart or sounds to your ears like an imprecation within Wikipedia context or is too high-flying for Wikipedia, I cannot help you; but please do not impute to me views which I have never articulated and do not hold.  For you are not scoring the rhetorical points at which you aim, but rather reduce the level of discourse to the point which I thought was beneath you — by involving yourself in a tangle of your own making.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The case is very simple.  ‘Violation’ and ‘malfeasance’ involve here the claim of the infringement of Wikipedia guidelines by (two) administrators who, as such (i.e. as administrators), are charged instead with the safeguarding of those very guidelines.  Administrators, yourself included, do not, and cannot, play any role whatever within the Wikipedia scheme other than that of assuring that WP guidelines are implemented and not infringed by the users: there is no scope within the project, as it stands defined at present, for any other additional role that they might even potentially or hypothetically assume.  Even their efforts at protecting the site from vandalism, etc., are only within their purview as guardians of (published) house rules (which, in this case, define vandalism for example in ways differing from those understood by the general public) — nothing, nothing, not an iota more than that.  There is no mechanism here for ‘discretion’, ‘broad’ or otherwise, whereby they could obtain blanket license to violate those guidelines without accountability: the moment that such powers (to dispense with guidelines altogether) are vested in or arrogated by them, (1) they cease to be administrators and become ma-and-pa corner grocery’s owners, with the goods on the shelves their private property to dispose of as they see fit; and (2) Wikipedia ceases to be a community editing project and becomes the private fiefdom of a limited few.  So no, I do not believe you understand that you do not operate here in a vacuum of your own making: I am Wikipedia every bit as much as you are, thank you very much.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You allege that I ‘have misunderstood the essentials of the system’, without specifying wherein that misunderstanding might have consisted in.  You do not have the right to make such unsubstantiated allegations in this forum; those are hits below the belt.  You may say to me, ‘you have claimed xxx, which conflicts with stated policy xxx, and fails to take into consideration the fact that xxx, published here xxx’.  The right to make generalized unsubstantiated allegations amounts to the license to launch personal attacks, a practice that again runs afoul of Wikipedia policies.  You are now violating those policies yourself.  I am not concerned with your tone (whether ‘polite’ or ‘vehement’ and how that impacts my liking or disliking you), but with the substance of what you are saying and how that impacts the project we are both involved in.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I wish to state that your own demeanour here has always struck me as approximating something of a Big Brother from Orwell, a position in part claimed by a kind of doublespeak.  No one, not even the founder, holds here a monopoly on Truth (you might have called it ‘a system of permissions to hold opinions’): all views must be closely argued and fully substantiated, by everyone without exception.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Administrators found guilty of deliberately, with (malice or otherwise) aforethought, violating house rules, and subsequently showing remorseless, unreasonable, unreasoning, defiance to the challenges of such violations (on the strength that ‘I am an administrator and therefore I do not have to account for my actions to you’), must be removed as a matter of principle, and will be removed.  There is no other remedy, as failure to clean the house would amount to allowing it to sink to the lowest common denominator determined by such administrators (and their unaccounted and perhaps unaccountable private reasons which propel them to certain actions).  Enthusiasm for the project and other such factors cannot be sufficient qualification to make someone an administrator here: a certain integrity, a sense of ethics, and a modicum of objectivity (the ability, that is, to see beyond the tip of one’s nose), are also required.  While the fulfilment of these requirements cannot obviously be easily determined beforehand, the discharge of one’s mission as an administrator can be appraised retroactively, and such appraisal should determine whether a user should continue in his/her supervisory capacity.

Northumbria's fortunes were up-and-down in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors, particularly Mercia, and that is not to suggest that anyone chose Deiran preferences over Bernician ones.

As a long-time editor of Wikipedia, I would like to stress that the key to not going crazy here is patience and thick skin. Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place. By the way, if you really are sick of Wikipedia, you may want to take a look at Veropedia. It's not perfect, but it has some good points (and most of the editors and admins are Wikipedia alum). Anyway, good luck with whatever you decide to do!     : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1
466666569.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't appreciate your personal attack (``fruitless rabbit trails``) I did not say anything to incite that. I am a lawyer qualified in one jurisdiction, and pursuing qualification in another jurisdiction. In any event, this page only deals with Personal Jurisdiction, I did not think it appropriate to talk about other things. And, I thought that what I was adding would most obviously be related only to personal jurisdiction. If a sentence says ``apples, oranges etc`` you cant interpret pens and pencils as the ``etc``, its obviously only restricted to fruits. When I say that the head of state has no power to act outside his kingdom in an article titled ``personal jurisdiction`` it most certainly cannot be construed that he cant do ANYTHING in that other state, what is said has to be read in light of the subject being spoken of. Otherwise you can have absolutely ridiculous interpretations of what I have said. By that sense, any and every action of the head of state outside the territory would be illegal, thats insane. I dont think you are really objecting to what I am saying, I think this is more of a turf war, and you seem to have a problem with the fact that I have added something and you did not. If thats the case, I dont really care, this is something I am doing for spreading knowledge not for any personal gain, you may go ahead and abuse your power as an editor and deface the page. I shall however reiterate that if you have any objection with anything in particular you can tell me what exactly you want a cite for, ill try my best to get the cite.

These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline.

Charlesworth has written that ``Jesus did exist; and we know more about him than about almost any Palestinian Jew before 70 C.E.`` [Chars.JesJud, 168-9] Sanders [Sand.HistF, xiv] echoes Grant, saying that ``We know a lot about Jesus, vastly more than about John the Baptist, Theudas, Judas the Galilean, or any of the other figures whose names we have from approximately the same date and place.`` On the Crucifixion, Harvey writes: ``It would be no exaggeration to say that this event is better attested, and supported by a more impressive array of evidence, than any other event of comparable importance of which we have knowledge from the ancient world.`` [Harv.JesC, 11] Dunn [Dunn.EvJ, 29] provides an anecdote similar to the one above regarding Shakespeare. Referring to Wells' thesis, he writes:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    The alternative thesis is that within thirty years there had evolved such a coherent and consistent complex of traditions about a non-existent figure such as we have in the sources of the Gospels is just too implausible. It involves too many complex and speculative hypotheses, in contrast to the much simpler explanation that there was a Jesus who said and did more or less what the first three Gospels attribute to him. The fact of Christianity's beginnings and the character of its earliest tradition is such that we could only deny the existence of Jesus by hypothesizing the existence of some other figure who was a sufficient cause of Chrstianity's beginnings - another figure who on careful reflection would probably come out very like Jesus!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFinally, let's seal the coffin on consenus with these words from a hardened skeptic and an Emeritus Professor of History, Morton Smith [Hoff.JesH, 47-8] . Of Wells' work, this historian and skeptic of orthodox Christianity wrote:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I don't think the arguments in (Wells') book deserve detailed refutation.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``...he argues mainly from silence.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``...many (of his arguments) are incorrect, far too many to discuss in this space.``NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``(Wells) presents us with a piece of private mythology that I find incredible beyond anything in the Gospels.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNone of these scholars, we emphasize, are friends of fundamentalism or evangelical Christianity. Contrary to the protestations of the ``Jesus-myth`` consortium, they make their statements based on evidence, not ideology. Conspiracy and bias exist only in their own imagination.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, the fact is is that the complaint isn't relevant. The mainstream historian position, which would hardly be mostly Christian, supports the claim that Jesus was a historical person. All that quote does is try to attack the speaker's instead of the evidence, and it would be blatantly dishonest to try to include it. Provide all the arguments for the claim that you want - but this isn't one of them.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

Thus, it is inconsequential how the language/alphabet of another country uses such a term.  For example, if the term Iran was used different in say the Persian of Afghanistan, it is inconsequential for an article on Iran.  In Iran no one writes: ``Güney`` with such an alphabet in the Azeri publications there (say newspapers).  Because first of all, they use the modified Arabic alphabet and second, it is politically charged.  Second, the same region (a good portion of it like all of Western Azerbaijan) is called by Kurdish nationalists as ``Eastern Kurdistan``.  For example, in the Northern Federal region of Kurdish Iraq, they use East Kurdistan for all of West Azerbaijan with their own alphabet.  However, this does not mean we put ``Eastern Kurdistan`` in say the article West Azerbaijan for Kurdish language or here.   Thus what matters is mainstream and official publications within Iranian Azerbaijan, and even the term ``Güney`` is not used that much as the word ``Jonub`` is used for ``South`` more often then ``Güney``.

Becoming the TFA however is a different matter and some FAs have a year or more without being the TFA it depends on many factors as ultimately determined by Raul. Given that the rate of growth of FAs is AFAIK greater then one a day this isn't likely to change anytime soon. TFA is really somewhat seperate from the FA process, the only connection is that TFAs must be FAs of course. Being a TFA should be thought of as a bonus more then anything else and there's nothing intrinsicly different between an FA which has been TFA and one that hasn't; they're all FAs and if they not they should be put up for FAR.

No one disputes he mostly goes by Dado.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::You've been removing verified info from Dado Prso over the span of 8 years already (whilst with a straight face characterizing the work of other editors' as ``harping``), standing guard against, and I quote, ``Serb nationalist talking points``, a ``thinly veiled political advocacy``, and an ``unverified Serbian name claim``.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Also, whatever happened to that earlier claim of yours about including Dado Prso's real name in his bio constituting ``thinly veiled political advocacy``, and an ``unverified Serbian name claim``? Considering there are numerous non-Serb sources stating Dado Prso's real name to be Miladin, do you still see it as a Serb nationalist effort? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::So to recap. There are reliable sources meeting WP:BLP criteria under WP:SOURCE and WP:NEWSORG as 'factual content' (including a well-established news agency with numerous reprints) that explicitly state his real name is Miladin.

Note that ``slander`` has two senses: one legal, and one informal. The legal sense is not for me to determine.  The informal sense?  Um, try to interpret this as anything but slander:  ``I think it's going to come out that the only reason she got any books published at all was because her rich daddy was a huge big deal in the publishing world. And the reason she can't get any books published anymore is because her big rich daddy is retired now and no longer a heavyweight at all in that world.`` - Qworty. Not only do I interpret this as slander, but so do sober people on Wikipedia. And I quote Tvoz, with respect to your slander: ``Well, I think there certainly are questionable, maybe defamatory, allegations there, and it would seem that BLP policy is not being fully followed. This is a long-time editor who is well aware of policy, so suggesting that he/she step back was appropriate as a first step to diffuse the drama, and I see that the next step I expected, of asking the editor to remove the material him/herself, has been done at User talk:Qworty#BLP concerns by a well-respected admin. But policy calls for the material to be removed either voluntarily by its author or by any editor, as we have an obligation to not defame our subjects, even in the heat of argument.`` For what it's worth, the word ``defamatory`` is in fact a legal designation. Moreover, if I were discussing the law - which I'm not - then I would be using the term ``libel,`` which covers written/published defamation, as opposed to slander, which - in the strict legal sense - pertains to speech.   `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

Something between a representative schematic and an illustration, with elements of both, possibly centred around this 4-stroke engine animation? To add would be the intake tract (air cleaner, intake manifold) and the exhaust tract (exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, muffler, pipeworks).

This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI will appreciate your discussing the changes and contributing with additional insight and referenced facts. Please do not merely undo my edits.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKind regards.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Please do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.  Your POV edit sought to give those facts WP:UNDUE prominence.  Your behaviour was also to edit war to keep that edit, hence my warning was appropriate.  And as Gibnews points out the correct place for that discussion was the article talk page.

One article is the parent article, it should include some history of how the game developed from Whist and that article would be Contract Bridge.  That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.  But I don't believe it would be appropriate to do more than touch on bidding systems.  Rubber bridge is the way Contract Bridge is scored.  Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.  But I would very much like to see these articles be friendly and readable so that a person who had never played bridge could read them and could find a logical development of complexity and of expertise required.  So that a green player could view both how to begin to learn to play and where the top is too, that people make their living at playing bridge, that there are international tournements of great interest, that some top bridge players are recognized by various public figures and so on.  So that a person can follow the logical development of being a beginning player, right through to becoming a top player.  And the joy of the intellectual compitition combied with the social intercourse of sitting at a table with 3 people.  We could compare that, perhaps, to Chess which is likewise an intellectual compitition but is less social with each board lasting longer and being less casual.  You know what I mean?

That way, no matter what happens with Nancy Cartwright, we can be sure that Nancy Cartwright (actor) will always work correctly, and the discussion can stay on Talk:Nancy Cartwright where it belongs.  As for the value of two-article disambiguation pages, they let the reader (and editors) know that there is more than one person with that name, in a much more noticeable way than a hatnote.  It makes it a lot easier to check that links are made to the correct article, since ones to an unqualified name will show up in the various ``links to disambiguation pages`` reports.    `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",test,-1,-1

And your claim of double standards was being brought which you failed to address convincingly. The Azeri term is the Turkic term; Jerusalem’s foreign names are there for a reason. All Persian, Urdu and Hindi qualify as such because they are relevant and present in several historic documents, maps and manuscripts influencing other languages words for the place. There is no proper Azeri distinct term for the place, it is the official Islamic term and the variants are either Turkish or Persian. We can write Jerusalem in Zulu language too, it doesn’t mean it has any historic or notable value. The evidence above documents that the edit happened in a period when you have found various articles where Armenian terms were present and added Azeri terms when it was not relevant. It was explained to you that the Armenian term for Jerusalem was present because there is an Armenian Quarter in Old Jerusalem and there are manuscripts dating back to a millennium and a half. As for the notability, if you’d have taken the time to read others concerns, you will actually remember one example, in which it was asked to you to provide another source while you were stuck to one article in Azerbaijani admitting to have nothing else.

I'm not sure the 'greek cross fractal' needs to be mentioned so much given that it doesn't seem to be a particularly interesting shape in any obvious way. Furthermore, the picture of the 2d greek cross fractal shows an early stage approximation to it. As mentioned the limit would just be a square.

Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette.

If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject?

We don’t use ``мај.``, ``јун.``, ``јул.``, ``maj.``, ``jun.``, ``jul.`` because there are already existing long forms in that shape (``мај``, ``јун``, ``јул``, ``maj``, ``jun``, ``jul``), and if we abbreviate ``јуни``, ``јули``, ``juni``, ``juli`` as ``јун.``, ``јул.``, ``jun.``, ``jul.`` we did it illegally because there are already ``јун``, ``јул``, ``jun``, ``jul`` as long forms that cannot be abbreviated (and are used in Serbian much much more often than јуни, јули, juni, juli).NEWLINE_TOKEN:So, yes: dot is ALWAYS required for short month names except for my famous 6 with extra 4 mentioned above (famous 10 in total).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*What you’have presumed is almost 100% correct, and code above should be actually 100% correct.

If she had repeatedly proclaimed her Jewishness in her reviews, and had become famous as being a ``Jewish American film critic``, then that would be important to note in the opening paragraph.  My point about the other critics was not that they are Jewish, but that whether or not they are Christian, Jewish, or otherwise is not even mentioned in the lead paragraphs of their articles.  Why should the Kael entry be any different?  Again, it is already mentioned in the article that her parents were Jewish, so its not like I'm attempting to keep something important from ``public display``.- NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Of what relevance, is it then, that she is an ``American film critic``? Since she doesn't deal only with American filims. This refers to her being an American. Why is that there? The plain and simple fact is that she is a Jew, religiously and ethnically. If it is so important that she not be labelled as such then we can just leave it out but let's make your rationale quite clear. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Well, the relevance of Kael being described as an ``American film critic`` is because that is exactly why she is/was famous.  It is standard to discuss somebody's nationality in the lead paragraph of an encyclopedic entry, not their religious beliefs unless that was one of the defining characteristics of their fame.  And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic.  If she was a practicing Jew (and I have no idea if she was or not), she never discussed it in print (as far as I can recall) or in any interviews, and it didn't seem to be reflected in her critical POV.  Now, if she had repeatedly brought up her ethnicity/religion in her reviews as some kind of critical barometer, I could easily understand why somebody would feel compelled to describe Kael as a ``Jewish film critic``.  But she didn't do that.  And again I direct your attention to any of the other film critic articles on wikipedia.  Is Roger Ebert a ``Christian film critic``?  Andrew Sarris an ``atheist film critic``?  Not according to wikipedia they're not.  (I'm using those two as examples...I don't know or care what, if any, religious background they may have).  And as I've previously pointed out, it  is already noted in the ``Biography`` section of the article that her parents were Jewish.

If some Jws are not happy, why don't they put some 'positive' books in the positive section as a balance? Reducing book descriptions until they are meaningless, or so vague that no one knows what they are about, is a rather surreptitious form of direct censorship, or reader manipulation at the least, and should not be encoraged.

The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded.

Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in ``Gary Takes a Bath``, but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.

I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. NEWLINE_TOKEN::It is done on children without their consent.  Most people would view this as ethically wrong - to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body (a particularly sensitive part at that).  NEWLINE_TOKEN::It can cause pain (people generally don't like to see children in pain).  NEWLINE_TOKEN::They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done.  They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.NEWLINE_TOKEN:: What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:: I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to.NEWLINE_TOKEN:: Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define ``circumcision`` would ask the question, ``which type? Male or female?`` In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.

I often find editing quite difficult (and a little depressing) and some RL problems are starting to interfere too! I did notice IP return once or twice and see he's had a go at adding refs. Maybe he's beginning to get the idea? Lotus 76 needs looking at I think. On another point if you get a minute can you look at Ford Mustang (fourth generation) where another editor seems confused about the meaning of RHD & LHD...seems to think America is RHD!

It did not involve a statement I had not yet made, during the non-actionable enforcement request. Therefore I did not violate the arbitration decision. The wording on my talk page clearly states that I violated the arbitration decision where you said the following: ``To enforce an arbitration decision``. You were not enforcing anything via the block, but rather making a unilateral decision to disregard evidence I pointed to and block me for accusatory language.
