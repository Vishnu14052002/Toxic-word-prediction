Maimonides' version clearly is widely used  Wikipedia's own article on the 613 mitzvot includes Maimonides' list as its only example, and describes Maimonides' work that included the list as ``The most important of the above works`` from a list of works that include versions of the list. It is also the only version that I have seen reproduced anywhere online. While Jay claims that the absence of aliyah from Maimonides' list should not be mentioned because virtually every other list includes it, that is not logical if Maimonides' list is ``the most important`` of the lists; it is essentially original research for Jay to conclude that the singularity of the absence of aliyah to Maimonides' list makes it not worth mentioning.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm sure it is true that others of Maimonides' writings indicate what Jay alleges, but the text from the article refers particularly to the 613 commandments. It would make sense (in fact, when I replace the wording, I'll do it myself) to note that Maimonides' other writings tend to contradict the omission, but that does not necessarily nor, I think, in fact warrant suppressing the note about the ``most important`` of the mitzvot lists being the exception to the statement in the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Jay describes the clarification as ``uncited POV,`` which may be true regarding ``most widely,`` which I eliminated, but not ``widely,`` nor anything else about the clarification.

Lukeno thought Portsmouth had won the Premier League so he's not exactly a good source. There is even an article for the surname McKay, but funnily enough I don't see an article for the surname Mckay ... which is because there is no surname Mckay only McKay or Mackay for the Scottish. Do some research on this because this is clearly an abuse of power, your attitude is right that one guy is obviously wrong because one source claims McKay to be the incorrect spelling and yet the BBC and other websites say McKay! I don't understand why they let user like you dictate what others can and can't do (fine for actually vandalism) but not when the consensus is wrong and the wrong decision has been given by  (yourself) a user that probably thought okay well the consensus says no so it's no, without actually doing some research on the name using the internet. Like I've said before, the Chrome spell-checker doesn't accept Mckay and wants to correct me with McKay. I am not Irish but I know a person with Irish heritage and that person's surname is McKeown - so are you trying to say that if a footballer comes along with that surname that you and the others are going to have the same approach and dismiss McKeown in favour of Mckeown?     : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

The Primary source is not only clear it is also backed up by the commentary ( and therefore secondary source) offered by Hippolytus. As you may remember from history classes, a source is primary only where its comments are not upon a prior source (in which case they become secondary).

Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. ``He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,`` Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. ``He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.``Henry Adams, ``The Session,`` North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  ``He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,`` a New England politician wrote his brother.

153679034.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, as I've already pointed out, doing a theme summary of 'Hamlet' is really no different from doing a character list.  The themes of 'Hamlet' are in 'Hamlet,' the same as the characters of 'Hamlet' are in 'Hamlet.'  It isn't complicated, the way some people try to make it.  And there is no ``original research`` in simply doing a theme summary, any more than there is ``original research`` in doing a character list.  Are you going to look at some book by Harold Bloom to find out whether Polonius is in the play, because otherwise you can't tell?  That would be nonsense, of course.  The same is true of the themes of the play.  The ``source`` for all the themes of 'Hamlet' is ``Hamlet.``  That is a fact.  And I have no idea where people are getting their strange and eccentric ideas of what a ``theme`` is.  Some people who have posted here need to go to Merriam-Webster online, and look up the word ``theme.``  A theme is a motif, a recurring idea.  That is factually what a ``theme`` is - look it up.  A final point, is it too much to ask that words should be spelled correctly in the article?  Look at what's there now  ``soliloquy`` is misspelled; ``cemetery`` is misspelled.  It looks terrible, and it's embarrassing.  Please, before you post something, just copy the text over to a text editor, and run a spelling check on it, since there doesn't seem to be a spell checker here.

The High Court found as a FACT and a RULING that my dad IS a lawyer and IS entitled to a number of issues the least the right of audience. A finding of fact! The Crown tried to appeal and were REFUSED! They had to pay costs. That is it! Why you wish to try and go beyond such is beyond me and it would appear all others. If it irks you that dad is a lawyer who practises worldwide then that is your problem. Don't inflict it upon others. my dad has a million and one faults but being a lawyer is NOT one of them. If you want to blacken him as it seems you do I and my brothers and sister can certainly tell you his faults. But for all his faults he is a great dad, always there notwithstanding he is away a lot and has done his best showing us love, affection and given us security despite his personal life. He is in Iraq a lot, he has access to HVD (High Value Detainees) represents Tariq Aziz, just managed to release Humad Humadi, even certain presidents dont get near Camp Cropper. If dad was not a lawyer do you think he would have access to the highest level of security in the world????? Or maybe he is a spy or something I guess that will be your next suggestion..... if you want scandal about dad find it elsewhere not where you are looking. MSDS  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

358613571.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `==Questionable punishment of D*98==NEWLINE_TOKENThe January 2010 block against User:Darryl98 was extremely harsh, IMHO, as being a 1-month block for a WP:3RR violation that was escalated by a more-experienced user who was well aware of goading people into a revert-war. Perhaps an 8-day block would have been more fair, with an attempt to discuss the situation during those 8 days, and possibly remove the block sooner than 8 days, after true consensus (that means a mutual agreement). Please understand that Wikipedia policies are actually much more fair, in writing, than the way some users (and admin users) misapply those policies: the typical block for WP:3RR is only a 24-hour block, not 1 month. In fact, per WP:Blocking_policy, use of excessive blocking is a violation due to the reasoning that new users will become highly irritated by excessive punishment. The idea of fair punishment isn't just a matter of human decency, or common sense when trying to actually ``collaborate`` with other users, no, much more than those reasons, fair punishment is a stated policy issue. I think what needs to be added, to avoid excessive punishment, is to develop a type of ``Code of Hammurabi`` as a list of wiki-punishments for each situation, based on length of tenure, total edit-count, and repeat-offenses, so that the punishment does NOT just become a matter of ``lengthen the block so a user won't come back soon to cause more trouble``. Meanwhile, rather than reducing future conflicts, excessive punishment poisons the Internet community with unhappy users who spread the word of how they were mistreated. Typically, users will not see unfairness as a few admins crossing the line and violating policies in a harsh manner, instead, a user victim is likely to ``blame Wikipedia`` for being a ``bad system`` that harrasses and abuses people. What needs to be emphasized, in discussions during a shorter block, is that some (many?) users (admins) violate policies, but this is not condoned, it's just hard to enforce because a banned user can return using a social-networking site that has thousands of IP addresses and Wikipedia cannot easily stop them. Also, Wikipedia has very limited appeal processes, and so there is nothing, yet, as sophisticated as even the ``American notion of justice`` in Wikipedia: there are no trials by jury of informed peers (chosen at random). Instead, many issues are decided by ``dog pile`` groups, who collect around a common bias or mindset, as a sort of ``feeding frenzy`` or hive mind that sees a negative remark as a veiled attack against the hive, and many members of the hive must sink into ``sting mode`` to counter-attack a person who states angry remarks. Currently, Wikipedia likes people who are ultra-mild and don't claim any Bill of Rights but simply beg to belong with the others. Hence, people from democratic republics come to Wikipedia and might demand their rights under the law, without realizing it is the Law of the Old West: be as nice as possible to avoid getting shot by other users/admins who are toting wiki-guns. Only some people think users have any rights to fair treatment, despite current WP policies that even require actions to be fair within those regulations. Perhaps WP needs to teach ``fairness classes`` to users who come from fascist countries or domineering parents: being fair and courteous is not a strong force of nature, but rather must be taught to users. - NEWLINE_TOKEN:Wikid, I'm sure that you are well aware of why WP cannot tolerate the improper use of WP:Sockpuppets. Just as your socking as Wz777 had to be stopped, so did PilgrimRose's socking as Darryl98. But blocks are not regarded as punishment, they are regarded as protection of WP from those who, like yourself, are having difficulty working within the rules. The indef block of a sockpuppet is applied equally to all such.   NEWLINE_TOKEN* If you read that user's larger prior talk-page revisions, you will see that the stated preference was to become named as ``Darryl98`` so I am respecting that request. In changing names, that user was not aware of how people can be goaded into a WP:3RR excess of revisions, and that escalation seemed to be the most serious of the policy violations. It is not a violation to have multiple usernames on Wikipedia. Plus, as an occasional user, it seemed that Darryl98 had spent extensive time to read the policies about WP:Sockpuppetry and properly explained each issue as it applied in the situation: no clear violation of puppets, but rather just being accused of ``nefarious`` intentions, which was noted as a violation of WP:AGF. Again, the largest disturbance was engaging in a WP:3RR violation, typically risking a 24-hour block, wh  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time ``Jesus Musician,`` I've recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.

568388765.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::To repeat what I'd already said at ANI, I am not alleging a topic ban breach, except perhaps under the ``broadly construed`` wording. I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of ``vandalism``, HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the ``Removals of the term British Isles (again)`` section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

Lord of the Rings was created here (Not the Movie) but the story trilogy was here. England is sort of similar to Australia, only older, more history, more pubs,more people,tiny parking spaces and so many red double decker buses. I'm doing all right for money and spent some at London's Best Gamesworkshop in Oxford Street. Gamesworkshops are bigger and better in England. I have been to a couple but can't buy much because of space in my ags. Rohan & Saun would love these Gamesworkshops in England. There are Mini Gamesworkshops in Villages smaller than Broadford, and still they are fanstatic. Bigger Gamesworkshops are manily in more bigger Towns and Cities eg Nottingham, London, Mancester, Oxford and many more. Tell Rohan that i went past the Gamesworkshop Headquarters, the Citadel Miniatures Factory and Warhammer World in Nottingham. But Unfortunaly i could not go because we had no time because our destination was Derbyshire and ran out of time. But I certainly will go there when i come back to England if i have time.

They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to ``bait`` or ``poke`` him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI lost respect for Malleus when he said, ``You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick.`` I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that ``we don't care if we offend our readers.`` Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and ``sex tape`` and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the ``nudge, nudge, lucky bastard`` type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked ``Should we mention the tape?`` Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've suffered chronic pain and fatigue since I had an unnecessary medical intervention at the a  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

In either case, whatever happened seems me worthy of mention.  The other possibility is that the people being tagged as ``Bukharan Jews`` are not actually Bukharan, but rather Ashkenazim who never felt obliged by halakha (viz. the situation in .il) to integrate into the local community, and are, therefore, being inaccurately tagged as ``Bukharan``, rather than as ``Jews from Uzbekistan``.

The issue is far wider than a dialog with ``pro-Moldovan`` interests. It is a a dialog with Russo-skeptic interests—and since Mauco has branded me a partisan, I'll identify that as my ``partisanship.`` I do not see this as an ethnic struggle for self-determination of Ukranians and Russians from Moldovans. I see it as a naked Russian power play (and not the only such one currently) to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against NATO expansion. Regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets, no impartial observer—and certainly no Russo-skeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as, minimally:NEWLINE_TOKEN* the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thugs who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, andNEWLINE_TOKEN* Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.NEWLINE_TOKENWhen that happens, and people then dance in the streets, then I will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.NEWLINE_TOKEN   You keep talking about the parliament's ``opposition`` to Smirnov. As a Russo-skeptic, I will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action, my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some ``elections`` which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. We can seriously discuss the will of the people:NEWLINE_TOKEN#after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);NEWLINE_TOKEN#after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become ``citizens of the PMR,`` either;NEWLINE_TOKEN#after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); andNEWLINE_TOKEN#after Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.NEWLINE_TOKENThen we can seriously discuss the validity of your interpretation.

What you have here is a page zealously defended by a bunch of nuts who are so zealous about their complete disassociation from Underwood despite comments by Church co-creator Ivan Stang regarding him AND conversations with him, that the protestations are evidence themselves of his effect on the Church.

330224413.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  Sorry, but i am rather certain that i have never said that Lindzen is on the fringes. There are rational sceptics (Lindzen, Christy, Pielke Sr.,...) and there are those who really are out on the fringes (Singer, Plimer, ...). And their biographies, no matter if they have a mainstream, minority or a fringe position, must be dealt with in the same way per BLP... But all of this is a distraction from the issue that i was trying to point at: That some of these biographies are being used as a coatrack for describing minority/fringe views, that do not fall under biographic material, and that BLP is used to circumvent NPOV by not describing the mainstream viewpoint. If you describe a minority or fringe viewpoint then you must also describe the mainstream and make sure that the reader is aware of the difference.   NEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

Nice work.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Since you don't object, I have added that section back to Little Boy.  That action should not affect its good article status.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Here is my reasoning.  That particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the Hiroshima bombing, which, in turn, was largely a public weapon effects demonstration.  Its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of, say, the Tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1,700 tons of bombs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Hiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target, a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target.  The two airplanes that accompanied Enola Gay were there to measure the weapon effects.  Nobody expected the loss of Hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender.  The ``shock and awe`` was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Most of what we know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of Hiroshima.  It was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks, and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured.  Nothing new was learned from Nagasaki, and no other bombs were tested on live urban targets.  In the many test explosions that followed, large and small, the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured, and the Hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Granted, it was pure happenstance that Little Boy, and not Fat Man, was used at Hiroshima, but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here.

I cannot help reconstruct given I deny there was a revolution, but only help with accurate historical and logical analysis of the (non-revolutionary) developments in the centuries of interest. The main problem of standard 17th century revolutionism for mechanics is essentially Duhem's deconstruction of alleged key developments of the alleged 17th century scientific revolution into the 12th to 14th centuries that essentially still stands. Perhaps details of that should replace the final 'literary criticism' section you removed ? Anyway, article's surely in an appallingly confused 'nowhereland' state at the moment.

Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was ``betrayed`` in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland.

I took the liberty of replacing ˡ (U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L) in the article with ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE) where it is used to indicate a stressed syllable. The former character is incorrect since although it appears as a vertical line in sans-serif fonts, it actually appears like a superscript lowercase l or a superscript 1 in serif fonts like Charis SIL and Doulos SIL. I only noticed this because I have a CSS hack that applies to all uses of the IPA template and forces a different font for them. I’m taking phonology at U. Hawaii at Mānoa so I’ll be sure to add anything interesting about Hawaiian that comes up. —  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Oh crap! Didn't even catch that.  I hope I haven't done it elsewhere.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Well, like I said, I only noticed it because I have a CSS hack in place. I only wish that the rest of the world had the SIL IPA fonts installed... —  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Again, glad you like the article. The replacement symbol you used looked alright to me, but so did the original symbol. It's a stretch to claim ``[t]he former character is incorrect`` on the basis of its appearance in fonts that 99.99% of users do not have. Most people have never heard of the Summer Institute for Linguistics. The character that I used to mark syllable stress is the one that Wikipedia presents for use in the IPA list of symbols below the edit box. So if you feel you have a ``better`` symbol, then you should contact Wikipedians who are in a position to consider implementing your suggestion(s). You might try Brion Vibber. If you learn something new about Hawaiian phonology at UH, do let us know. But remember, Wikipedia does not want anything that is not already published. So if it's ``new``, it might be unpublished, and therefore undesirable under Wikipedia policy.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::The font used to display the characters is unimportant. Their character encodings are specific. On the basis of the two Unicode names, I argue that U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is inappropriate as the stress marker in IPA. Checking the appropriate Unicode chart on their website I find that U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE is listed under the section “Miscellaneous phonetic modifiers” with the comment “primary stress, downstep; precedes letter or syllable modified”. On the other hand, U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is given in the section “Additions based on 1989 IPA” just below U+02E0 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GAMMA which has the comment “these modifier letters are occasionally used in transcription of affricates”. So it’s fairly clear that the Unicode standard makes a distinction between their intended purposes. I note that in the bottom of the edit box the two are given in sequence, with U+02C8 immediately following U+02E1. It’s easily possible to press the first of the two accidentally. I will bring this up at m:Help talk:Special characters and ask someone to reorder them for clarity. —  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Your explanation and argument sounds good. I don't know the layout of the ``insert box`` characters on other users' screens. When I edit, the IPA characters are displayed in two lines. The first line ends with tiny lowercase superscripts: h, w, a j-like character, gamma, ``lefty`` glottal, n. The second line begins with the character I used for stress mark, followed by other stress marks, length mark, something too obscure to make out, a mid-height black square (apparently used to mark the end of a series of related symbols), and then the line ends with the double-curly-bracketed IPA. Based on your explanation, it appears that the first line of IPA characters is broken in a way that misled me into thinking that the last member of the series of superscripts is the first member of a series of stress marks. Bad line break. And there is no mid-height black square, nor significant white space, separating the superscript series from the stress mark series. Not seeing that previously, I used the first mark because it looks the same as the second, but darker. Of course, it also happened because a tiny superscripted sans-serif L looks nearly identical to a tiny superscripted vertical line.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::If you have the motivation, maybe you can suggest more than just reordering in your communication with the Special Characters people. The addition of a separation character between the series of superscripts and the series of stress marks will help. Here's my best suggestion to offer on this matter - persuade the Special Characters folks to implement appropriate new text for the ho  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,1

I consider Max Van Sydow to be a very respectable actor but it's almost like they sedated him, took his soul and left him with one expression, he's like a zombie as Jesus. The film had me yawning all the way through and I genuinely had to check myself several times from shutting off for a kip! Never a bright moment, nothing to lift the mood, even the silly cameos in it. It's not that the film, the scenery or whatever is bog standard or dreadful, but its the way the scene are compiled and the lifelessness of the actors in it which make it exceedingly dull and uninspiring to watch. David Lean was apparently an uncredited assistant director on it which I find hard to believe. Uncredited perhaps because of sheer embarrassment with the result. I'm not sure how anything in which Lean so much as touched ended up that dull... I just saw Treasure Island (1972 film). Welles was perfect casting as Long John!

If you disliked the way it's written now, you should see what it said before I changed it.  And just removing the citation (which I spent quite some time finding) is not very helpful.  Anyway, other than my slightly bruised ego, your point about the citation not mentioning ETH is well taken.  Regardless of terminology they distinctly were *not* talking about ETH but about UFOs.  I will try to change it to reflect that.  What the citation supports is the notion that when scientists review the evidence at hand, they conclude that some UFO reports merit further study, but they don't really comment much on ETH.  E.g. the notion that there's even a minority support for ETH in mainstream science is wrong.  And leaving the comment ``a few scientists ...`` is zero info, since you can pretty much find a ``a few`` scientists supporting any notion.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a ``collective`` or amorphous ``group`` - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers.

For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the ``cherry on the sundae``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an ``audio drama festival``.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGiven that a number of Australian curators are already listed and are not the subject of dispute, there is clearly no reason why a curator, per se, can't be considered worthy of a Wikipedia entry. While Julie Robinson certainly isn't at the same level of public awareness as Betty Churcher or Brian Kennedy, her work is still significant, particularly in the field of Australian photography, which in my opinion is currently somewhat underrepresented on Wikipedia. The two exhibitions mentioned in the first paragraph where clearly of importance within that context, and as soon as I have the opportunity I intend to add a page on Century In Focus. Very briefly, that was a three-month exhibition at one of Australia's most important public galleries, accompanied by a large-format book that was distributed by Thames & Hudson. Ms Robinson spent years working on it, as the head of a team of curators. As Sebastian Smee, himself a Pulitzer Prize winner, put it: ``If you are at all interested in Australian photography, whether or not you are from SA, you will want to see this show, or at least get hold of the catalogue.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDpmuk has mentioned elsewhere that ``None of the sources are about her and there is no other indication of notability.`` I don't dispute that they are, in fact, about her work, but I don't believe that makes the page invalid. It was never intended to be an in-depth discussion of her personal history or background, but instead is meant to provide a way for people to find out more about her work, which, I'll reiterate, is certainly of importance. Exhibitions are an important part of our public culture – they inspire and educate – and as such they fully deserve to be written about.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere would obviously be no place for mention of the other exhibitions that Ms Robinson has curated in the page on Candid Camera or Century in Focus, so removing the page, while perhaps making Wikipedia more compliant and slightly tidier in dpmuk's view, will also remove what was always intended as a hub for people to learn more about art and photography in Australia. Personally, I don't know enough to add entries for all of the other exhibitions she has curated, but I'd like to think that, in time, they too will have their own pages, and the page currently in question will still be here to serve as a hub for further discovery.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKnowledge and education should always trump bureaucracy.`  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context.

First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.NEWLINE_TOKENOn Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.NEWLINE_TOKENSo, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her ``clean up`` what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.NEWLINE_TOKENFormer associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.NEWLINE_TOKEN``There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.

There are also rumors of a Greatest Hits album to be in the works after their Hollywod Records debut is avalible for some time. And since, they re-recorded Cheetah Sisters as an actual group, without Raven, I am asuming that if a Greatest Hits album does eventually come along, it will be full of re-recorded material that does not include Raven. If you also bought the Cheetah Girls Party's Just Begun Tour book, you will see that there is a photospread in there, and one of the pictures originally containted Raven.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLook on the main page for this group and find their picture.

However, IMO the text in the article is too strong for what the source supports.  NEWLINE_TOKENconclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.  This is not a strongly worded conclusion, where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study.  I continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text.  Clearly, further research on this controversial matter is needed.  Can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match?  The strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed.  Regards,   `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

567018805.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT ``an exact parallel`` to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by ``scholars`` no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say ``It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus`` would we? Rather, we would say that ``AIDS is caused by the HIV virus`` or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, ``AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus.`` That's because ``is considered to be`` also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::What I see in the present ``It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement`` wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could ``get away with``  (saving the even less acceptable ``misogynist`` for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could ``get away with``: ``It is considered to be``. I don't particularly like ``backlash`` in lead, but at least in should be framed in the more NPOV ``many scholars and other observers have described it as a backlash . . . ``   `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

As a consequence, was barred by the ORI from receiving or applying for federal grants for three years in the 1990s.  So he's previously gotten into serious trouble for throwing out data that doesn't fit his preferred hypothesis.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::In recent years, his publications seem to be almost exclusively low-impact papers, opinion bits, and letters related to Morgellons and the related dubious diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.  I suppose it's possible that he might be ``leading his field``, but if so it's taking an awfully long time for anyone to start following.  It's looking much more like he's just wandering in the wilderness.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::And the advent of the ``open-peer-review`` journals (where the journal publicly posts the identities and sometimes the comments of peer reviewers) opens a window on at least some mild shenanigans regarding reviewer selection in some of his recent papers.  This 2013 F1000 paper has a publisher's note about an undisclosed conflict of interest, where one of the reviewers was co-authoring another manuscript with the paper's authors while reviewing the F1000 paper.  And one of the reviewers of the current paper (BMC Dermatology, 2015) was Robert Bransfield , who is actually acknowledged in the paper (!) () for his contributions.  This sort of thing has a couple of likely explanations—Stricker (et al.) are deliberately pointing journal editors at very friendly peer reviewers (and these mostly-crappy, low-impact journals don't do much due diligence), potential conflicts of interest be damned; or these papers are so far out on the fringe that it's very difficult for journal editors to find anyone who is willing to waste time on reviewing manuscripts on these topics, so they're relaxed about their reviewer standards; or both.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

Besides what I stated above, here are my thoughts: I have nothing contrary to the citation of a contemporary author that has done a serious study on Vojsava Tripalda and doesn't blindly repeat that she was from Serbian origin. The only contemporary scholar that we have to claim that Voisava Tripalda was from Serbian origin is Spandounes, who says only that, and then he points to the biography of Marin Barleti. Now Barleti doesn't say that she was Serbian, but Albanian, so Spandounes contradicts himself. If we really want to give some references to Skanderbeg that are sour, let's start with Oliver Jens Schmitt who really has made a bad biography of the national hero of the Albanians. Schmitt is a voice out of the choir and I would love if someone brings to the table what he says, because I want to see if he is fringe or serious. `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

Just as several people have suggested that information cited only from Counterpunch's article is questionable, the revelation of these court records equally, if not moreso, calls into question the accuracy of any information cited from the Eichenwald article.  Without citing the Eichenwald court records, it still seems reasonable that without secondary citation (itself not referencing the Eichenwald article), any information from his article should be carefully reviewed and probably removed due to a fairly obvious conflict of interest.

That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) ``Ebonics``, (2) ``Pan African Communication Behaviors`` and/or (3) ``African Language Systems``.  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing ``Ebonics`` as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English`` (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English`` (and thus a rejection of the notion of ``African American Vernacular English`` but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)`` is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.

378142479.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:Did you hear this with relation to an Euclidean topology or some other naturally occuring topology? It cannot be redundant in general since if we take a non-empty set X and choose a non-empty proper subset U of X, then the ``topology`` on X consisting only of U would satisfy the two axioms you stated but would not contain X nor the empty set. Of course, this is a trivial example. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Suppose we call a collection of subsets of a set X a ``relevant topology`` (this is not a real name; just something I made up just now so it is easier to talk about these things) if it satisfies every axiom except possibly that ``X and the empty set are in the topology``. Then a non-empty set with a ``relevant topology`` that is Hausdorff (here ``Hausdorff`` means that any two distinct points are separated by neighborhoods; the same definition as the usual one on topological spaces) would necessarily have to include the empty set in the ``topology``. Thus for ``many`` topological spaces, requiring the empty set to be open is indeed redundant. NEWLINE_TOKEN:On the other hand, the requirement that the whole set X be open is in general not redundant with fairly natural topologies (I suppose). For example, take any topological space X and let Y be a set containing X as a proper subset. Declare a subset of Y to be open if and only if it is in the topology on X. Then this ``relevant topology`` on Y satisfies every axiom that a topological space should satisfy except that Y itself is not open. For example, X could be some Euclidean space with the standard topology (and Y could be any set containing X as a proper subset). But this construction is probably not very interesting since (at least as far as I can see) there is not any new information or insight obtained.NEWLINE_TOKEN:This might be too elementary for you, but I wrote the following section in open set a while back that roughly describes why the axioms are the way they are and the motivation for the abstract formulation of a topology: Open_set#Motivation. The following discussion at MathOverflow may perhaps be more appropriate to your question: Do the empty set and the entire set really need to be open?.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKEN18:09, 2003 Oct 28 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks, that may at least defuse things a little.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy personal thought is that if this is to get any mention on Ferdinand or Ferry Porsche's page the text should relate to them directly, rather than being the same cut and paste sentence.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMentioning that Ferdinand Porsche gets most of the popular credit for a lot of things that were actually as much or more a product of his employees, and pointing out that this is common practice in the design industry  the boss gets the credit  would be a bit more NPOV.  Mentioning Komenda as one of those who gets overlooked in favor of the boss would be OK for me too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Before I get any further on this subject, I would like clarificaton about the relative roles of Ferdinand and Ferry in this issue.  I would like to see the fact of Ferdinand's univolvement nailed down before I approach the matter of Ferry, or before I try to address the simple revert battle now going on here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The bulk of the story clearly belongs on the Komenda page.  A one-sentence reference on the Ferry page saying that Ferry's claim is disputed is appropriate, and it should then refer those who want more on the story to the Komenda page.  01:57, 2003 Oct 29 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::This is the situation that I think is the truth, from my reading.  When Ferdinand Porsche set up an independent engineering consultancy in Germany (in the 30s?) although he was the company founder and head engineer he employed a number of other engineers - the jobs were too big for just one man.  Among the men he employed was Erwin Komenda, who had previously worked for Daimler-Benz and before that Steyr.  Komenda was an expert in auto body construction and the engineering of pressed sheet metal bodywork, that I can determine.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Ferdinand Porsche's field of expertise seems to have been the mechanical aspects of vehicles, engines and the like, and the overall team direction.  Komenda worked on the bodywork of the KDF-wagen (later to become the Beetle) among others.  Komenda definitely worked on translating ideas for the basic shape into sheet metal and the detail design of the bodywork.  Many of the plans and patent applications from this period are signed by Komenda and applied for with his name on them.  Whether his were the first pencil sketches that were turned into auto bodies I am less sure.  It's certainly possible that they were, though I am sure others in the team including Ferdinand Porsche had a lot of input.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJUST A THOUGHT:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENShouldn't this page consider division into chapters:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(i.e.)NEWLINE_TOKENEarly LifeNEWLINE_TOKENWWINEWLINE_TOKENWWIINEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPorche is a fascinating man with a career so linked with the World Wars  but that almost seems lost and in this bio. His involvement in WWII with the Nazis in both the Racing circuit and in the War effort really shaped his life and that that of the world. He represents a true place in history - so perhaps a chapter insersion could better work here.  Just a suggestion.NEWLINE_TOKENDH - 10/16/05NEWLINE_TOKEN::Postwar, Porsche's son Ferry and the other engineers who had worked for Ferdinand during the war came together (initially in Austria) to design cars.  Ferdinand was imprisoned until 1949 for war crimes relating to the use of slave labor in projects he worked on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Between them, a car was designed that became the Porsche 356.  Komenda played a big part in this.  It would be incorrect to say that he was the designer, per se, because he only worked on the bodywork.  However, its construction was his, and probably much of its styling.  He also worked in a similar capacity for later Porsche cars.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::What I think needs to be done is to write more about Ferdinand's consultancy and Ferry's postwar sports car company so Komenda can be placed in his proper context.

I recommend that the following be added:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo speak of the ``scramble for Africa`` is to begin a debate centuries old. In the words of Robert Collins, ``The explanations [for the colonization of Africa] are nearly as unsatisfactory as they are numerous.  The misconceptions are as enduring as they are erroneous.  To scholar and student alike, the search for understanding this dynamic period, which resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and dramatically altered the future of a vast continent, is the Problem of the Partition of Africa.``Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy 1870, many European nations were interested in the African interior, and began moving up the rivers.  Generally, except for a few cases, foreign powers could not move beyond ``small coastal enclaves.`` Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301  But from the years of 1880-1900, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: Liberia, an independent state partly settled by African Americans; and Orthodox Christian Ethiopia (known to Europeans as ``Abyssinia``). Colonial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe scramble came from the rising of a new world from old Europe.  Until this point, Britain had been the undisputed leader in the industrial realm.  They could produce more manufactured goods than any other country, and at the lowest price.  Britain promoted the idea of ``free trade`` in Africa, the idea that no European countries would interfere with one another while freely trading in Africa.  Britain had no worries until the 1860's when ``France, Germany, and the United States had caught up with Britain in terms of industrial technology and manufacturing.`` Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301 NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a result of this industrialization of the world, there was a shortage of markets to sell to.  many European countries, as a result, looked to Africa as a potential client. Some believed when diamonds were discovered in 1869 they ``provided the incentive and capital for a large influx of Europeans.``Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7  The creation of the Suez Canal ``not only made the East African coast more accessible but also became the great pivot in British imperial strategy.``ibid., 7 Above all else, we must look at this imperial world pragmatically and not ideologically. Until this point, ``military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe.  Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage.`` John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800, second edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 7NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut a new world, as noted above, had begun.  Because of new competition in the trading industries of Europe and the Americas, Britain now had rivals for trade in Africa.  Even smaller countries sometimes wanted to get involved looking for quick cash and to find ways to sustain their countries.  Within the hubris of the European nations was the ideal of ``national prestige,`` an idea that holding African colonies would increase the power of a nation.Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 303 New technology as well in the form of the ``repeater rifle`` and the ``maxim-gun`` gave Europeans new advantages over Africa.

The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the ``Turk Superracism`` everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true.

Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN``The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables.

But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI ask, of course, because you are a ``relatively famous Wikipedian`` who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

I'm still that same guy, sometimes full of shit (includes humor), sometimes with some or even much professional attitude. Maybe I needed it. Maybe not.

But that sticking to the rules is a rotten ``primary directive``, and calling spade spade is even more necessary, because it's simply more accurate.

Crows feature more prominently in common parlance (proverbs etc.) - therefore sometimes other crow-like birds (ravens etc.) are called simply crows, but on the other hand if one says kavka he/she certainly refers specifically to a jackdaw and doesn't mean vrána (either of two species native to the Czech lands - Carrion Crow Corvus corone or Hooded Crow Corvus cornix). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBeing unfamiliar with Japanese naming of the various Corvidae I hope this will help to clarify the naming issue at least from Czech perspective. Presumably that inaccuracy/oversimplification arose in chain of translation across several languages.   `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer ``they are the only true adherents of democracy.``[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term ``is a slur intended to ... express contempt.``[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only ``deeply committed`` Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is ``trivial``.[2][3] [4]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHistory of usageNEWLINE_TOKENThe earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, ``Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.``[5]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWilliam Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled ``by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'``[7]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDo you see the difference? All the way through, the dispute about the term should be the subject of the article, not whether it *really* means one thing or another.

That's different from the East German culture, which has never, ever been a component of Americana and might never be either.  Try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face.  You have to put the German issue in context; Benjamin Franklin was hostile to ``Palatine Boors`` as he called them, but the Quaker establishment which founded Pennsylvania loved him to death.

I don't maintain as some do, notably  that your viewpoint should be totally suppressed but I do think it needs to be put in perspective as the distinctly minority view it is.

A bit weird they all show up within a couple days, isn't it?  LOL  The editor who made this move request regularly communicates offsite through e-mail, hence my suspicions.  Anyway, you'd think people could compromise, wouldn't you?  I guess history tells us that some humans are not capable of compromise...  So, anyway, as far as your research, and I'm not sure where you are based, but if you are in the United States, try dropping by a Whole Foods, etc.. and you'll see that products from this region are labeled as coming from Alto Adige.   This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.

The Confectioners' and Ice Cream Manufacturers' Protective Association announced yesterday that it has completed plans for popularizing the day in New York. There are about 1,800 candy stores in this city, and about 550 are members of the association and manufacture most of the candy they sell.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn every one of the members' stores special displays will be arranged, and each customer will receive souvenirs, E. A. G. Intemann Jr., President of the association said. Pa, Ma, and the kiddies will all be supplied with a piece of home-made candy, mostly in the form of peppermint sticks. There has been so much interest manifest among confectioners and such enthusiasm over candy day that the association has offered prizes for the best display of candy manufactured on the premises and for the most artistic piece of candy manufactured. Mr. Intemann said that the candy entered in the competition would, in his opinion, be masterpieces of the candymaking art.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Let Candy Day be a time when everyone feels young again,`` he said. ``Everybody likes candy, and we all want to make the day one of happiness for all; a day to bring back the memory of the time when a pilgrimage to the candy store for a stick of peppermint or a hunk of molasses taffy was an event to be looked forward to. I recall even now the childish pleasure I derived from a visit to the little store in our block and the pride with which I returned home attached to a stick of candy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I met a man the other day who said when he heard of Candy Day that it recalled just those things to his mind, and he started out to see whether he could still find the particular kind of candy that used to delight him. He did, and so it is not so very far-fetched to say that Candy Day will revive our youth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The association wants to see Candy Day firmly established, and the public can rest assured that, so far as this organization is concerned, the day will not be made an excuse for gouging. Prices will remain the same as on every other day. What we do want, however, is to see every man, woman and child enjoy candy on next Saturday.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough Candy Day was instituted in 1915, the confectioners made no effort to celebrate it. This was because of the war, and later because of the sugar situation. Saturday, Mr. Intemann says, will be New York's first real Candy Day.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Sweetest Day/Candy Day ads for October 14, 1922 have so far been located in the New York Times, The Buffalo Evening News, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Cleveland Press, and The Chicago Daily News.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy not edit these facts into the article.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  NEWLINE_TOKEN  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.  It just seems a bit more accurate.  NEWLINE_TOKEN  Hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc... Thoughts?  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

No one yet has any clue as to what genes work to produce hair form and yet we here such facts, probably from the view point of some American or Western person who's most familiar dark skinned group are people with mostly recent West AFrican ancestry. And admixture with whom, themselves? As i've said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field (we may be getting closer) and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair, all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair, while the daughters don't. Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth. Again, who says the whole range has to originate from admixture instead of slow evolution of diversity (which decreases on its way to Eurasia, so you'd have to hypothesize on they instantly loose diversity in comparison with others, including Native American groups who weren't even there long enough to become depigmented.NEWLINE_TOKEN    : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

That's another performance shock for me: one article bypasses cache. I cleared my entire browser cache, and then Assange showed the cache-page copy. As for broad resistance, the Continuous Improvement movement (Kaizen, etc.) has warned, ``People dislike change``. Most act like the ``boiling frog`` and sit while the temperature rises, never moving until too late and ``Beyonce`` runs 26 seconds (or Assange 18). I advised Jimbo, to add ``More pillars`` where Performance becomes a major priority, like Civility or NPOV, rather than ``personal preference to see results`` in the same hour, while they demand the cite-tools still work. You might know I've had severe rejections trying to defuse essay wp:PERF, and explain how the Titanic sank because ``Don't worry`` thwarted other people from acting or improving (the ship design included ample lifeboats rejected by others). This year, with the Costa Concordia in Italy, passengers worried enough about the tilting ship to call land-based police to complain the ship seemed damaged while crew pretended ``Don't worry``. Enough. I think we are reaching ``critical mass`` to move forward here. The next compromise consensus supports all parameters (as demanded pronto), and auto-runs the quick citations, with later promises to ``fix`` {Citation/core} where possible, and still support those cite-tools which generate {cite_web} calls and such. It is a hideously complex upgrade, with over 23 forks as {cite_book}, {cite_video}, {cite_document}, {cite_press_release}, {cite_encyclopedia}, even ``{citeweb}`` or ``{cite web}`` but fixing the most-used will cure the speed problems. Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate ``surname1`` for ``last1`` where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so ``Assange`` can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview.

The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDespite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN-         That Mithras, after whom it is named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in Christianity, see Acts 4:12).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN-         He was born in a cave or in a corner of the earth (cf.

That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a ``graduate program``, and the degrees it grants are ``graduate degrees``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion.  It's worth noting that in practice, it's extremely rare to find a medical student in the US who doesn't already have a degree from a four-year college.

When I wrote ``75(note 15)`` above, I should have written ``75([superscript:]??`` looks like ``25`` or ``2.5`` in GBooks' representation. When I looked at this entry on p. 3-366 before, it looked like ``15``. Also, on ``Explanation of Table`` p. 3-2, I readNEWLINE_TOKEN::::``The data in the table have many sources, including both the primary literature and evaluated compilations.  The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28).``NEWLINE_TOKEN:::So this suggests that some temperature values in the table are automatically derived but as I say, the ``25`` or ``2.5`` is a raised, reduced-sized font, not parenthesized. So the superscript may well refer to alternate sample pressure - I can't find whatever it references. I apologize if this dwells on this source too much; I think the consensus here that the bp is significantly higher than 75'C is dispositive.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Image from WMAP press release, 2006 ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis image is quite puzzling and deserves a wider comment. I believe that the grid is physically correct but the image of the CMBR on the left as a surface (rather than as a circle) and the representation of stars as points rather than geodesics, are simply artist concepts and readers should be warned. Any objection against pointing out the ambiguity of an image from a qualified source? Do you believe they are really correct?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:(Image copied here for easier reference) I have mixed feelings. On the one hand it's one of those pictures that's ``pretty`` but doesn't do a great job of illustrating the actual science. On the other hand it could do a lot worse. I'm still trying to figure out what the scale (radius of the circular cross-sections) is supposed to represent. It's not the FRW scale factor because then the inflationary epoch and the CMB would be invisible (smaller than a pixel). Then I thought it was the comoving radius of the observable universe, but then it shouldn't flare outward on the right or have that point on the left (the graph of the comoving radius can only be concave upward if the universe is shrinking). Maybe it's the scale factor with a significant amount of distortion to make the early eras visible, but then the ``Inflation`` label is pointing to the wrong place—it should be pointing basically where ``Quantum Fluctuations`` is pointing. Or it could be the log of the scale factor, but that has the same problems as the comoving radius.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The illustration of the evolution of the galaxies is kind of cool, and could perhaps be justified by saying that they took slices of the universe of nonzero thickness at intervals of, say, 100 million years and stacked those on top of each other.

We could go on about how Lyoto hit the better targets and with better technique in terms of penetration (see Rua's black eye, etc...) but I am saying that using Fightmetric is unreliable. It is supposed to be guys who have PHDs in statistics judging a fight based on what they though was power. You have no monitoring of consciousness, heart rate, x-rays,etc...all you have is heresay and a biased opinion. Fightmetric is not used on Lyoto's page either because it is biased. It even records Rua's leg kicks to Lyoto's legs as more powerful than Lyoto's round kicks to the body; a clear biased view of Maui Thai compared to Shotokan Karate especially since Lyoto's legs are traveling a slightly further distance and hitting a more vulnerable area (ribs, kidneas, liver, intestines, you be the judge). Enough with the biased views, FightMetric is not valid and I say that any who relie on its pseudoscience is a one-sided fool. If they where hooked up with equipment that didn't hinder there abilitys to record the Force i.e. F=MA or Force= MasX Acceleration and if they could at least clock the speed of the kicks and the mass of Rua's legs as compared to Lyotos I might back Fightmetric, but until then it is not good evidence of anything but a for profit site.  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,1

However, I can't go into that much detail myself because I certainly don't have the time to do that much research. That quote from Iliad is rather odd. Homer seems to be refering to Hesiod's earlier Theogony; but the details are different. The Perseus Digital Library (whose pages take some time to load; so for anybody reading this, be patient) translates Homer's quote just as you say (line 14 onwards), and has this to say for Theogony (line 720 onwards). I'm no classicist, but I'd be weary of that bit of text - it is certinly odd and probably should not be taken at face value so naïvely. As you say, everywhere else (as far as I know) he refers to the underworld as the ``domain of hades``. As for Erebus, the quotes from Iliad (under the heading: 3 from Homer, Iliad), at face value, seem to indicate that it is a place. But this is merely a misunderstanding of what Erebus is. Erebus is the gloom, the darkness of the underworld, the ``place of dark mists`` as you put it. Replace ``Erebus`` with ``darkness of the underworld`` or the like and the quotes make just as much sense as the assumption that Erebus is a physical location. However, I don't know of any source that explicitly states that it is a location in the underworld; so, again, where does that quote come from?  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

Could you add maybe one more line to define what you mean by 'commonality'? Do you mean: commonality of academic opinion? agreed upon terms of what the a particualr word might mean in a historical context? And I'm guessing that the factors you indicate that are important are the origin and age of any given word. I really cant quite see what you might think was insulting about the introduction... (I didnt write it by the way)... I think the point of the intro was to define where the word 'philology' came from... In latin it means 'grammatica'... Greek? I recall that 'philo' means love, and 'logo' ... well i dont know... But the origin of the word i imagine can have a number of sources... That is what makes words interesting and vibrant to me. I hope you can help clarify my question. I just think your entry could open a whole other line of questioning about the nature of philology. It is why i entered the concept that Nietzsche was a radical philologist... Anyway, some food for thought...     `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0

If that pisses other editors off (and how many other editors would that be?), it says something about them, not about me. I have no interest in ``owning`` an article. But I have worked long and hard to do a good job and deserve to have my work treated with respect, which BMK has certainly not done. Just look at the section above titled ``Wallack's Theatre.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Rewrite the article to your heart's content; just make sure you are improving it. The claim that I think I own the article is BMK's complete fiction. If you look at the record, you will see that I have welcomed constructive changes. But Wikipedia has a rule about collegiality and collaboration. Making many and significant changes to someone else's work without discussing it with him is not collaboration, it is contemptuous. Look  how I interacted with him here (under cul-de-sac). Do you think I deserve to be treated the same way? I do.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Just try to change an article that BMK has edited. I have  and have almost always been immediately reverted, even though in most cases it turned out I was right. And these instances do not concern matters of taste; they concern matters of fact. This has happened many times  most recently here (by coincidence, on October 3rd). So BMK has a double standard: one for him, and the opposite for me (and presumably everyone else). I give respect to those who give me respect; most often I have been treated by him with dismissive disdain.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::The reason I blanket-reverted his changes (I didn't even look at them) is only that: that his way of going about editing my article was contemptuous. He reminds me of Lucy kicking down Linus' sand castles in Peanuts. I was not objecting to the content of his changes (although I do, to some of them), but to the process. Observe how Moonriddengirl did it: She discussed the issues on the article's Talk Page first  and I had no trouble making the changes. Is it too much to expect BMK to do the same?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::As for Footnote 1, that was someone else's contribution, as the record shows (see the history at 26 June 2013); I merely relocated it to where I thought it was more appropriate.

If you think the article is better without it, delete it (you might want to explain the reason for doing so to that contributor, as he deserves an explanation).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::And speaking of original research, you might want to have a look at the edit war here (discussed above in the section ``Madison Square depot``) and explain to me how the note I added constitutes ``original research`` and is therefore unacceptable. And how about the edit war here. Can you explain BMK's behavior in that case? (And notice that BMK began editing my article again for the first time in two months on October 2nd, right after these three exchanges  Madison Square depot, the map image, and the categories. Could it possibly be spite?)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::The problem is not me; for a year I have been a conscientious editor, and carefully sensitive to the feelings of others, including BMK. But although we have occasionally had cordial exchanges, for the most part, I did not receive similar treatment in return. And now he is completely misrepresenting me and our history.

For a variety of reasons Iraq was a central link in this chain. Perhaps I could put it this way.

Alot of people contribute to this page and you seem to want to delete EVERYONES work. The reality is there is very little documentation on Trance music in texbooks. This poses a problem. In this scenario the Wiki relies on the followers of the genre to input their expertise FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. If this weren't the case the page would be almost absolutely empty with nothing in it. I know you like to say there are rules for this and that, but in this case because there is no documented research, it is all we can work with. Be happy with what is provided. Lastly the removing of Discogs as a reference is the most bizarre thing I've ever heard. Trance music is about the music...and it was experienced through records NOT BOOKS.

If blocking admin doesn't understand that then he shouldn't be an admin. ARBMAC also seems fundamentally broken - created by a decree to give godlike powers to admins in arbitrary topics, and arbitrarily expanded in ``maintenance motions`` (as one ArbCom member described it). It should be repelled because it's being abused by nationalist gangs who eagerly collect ``evidence`` to block rare NPOV editors such as me or  who rather take time editing articles than waste it making enforcements, sockpuppet investigations and debates where interlocutors such as yourself simply dismiss sources because they are not Croatian (or whatever).

What presses 'set fit to print' is often a calculated judgement on, what the owners prefer, what advertisers on them won't object to, and what the readership that buys the paper would prefer to read. As one sees at critical moments, in The Times of London, or The New York Times, reportage can be devastatingly skewed. This goes for the mainstream press. The second proposition has nothing to do with either comprehensiveness or accuracy of reportage, but rather 'who cares. I like it, I want the readership to think this way'. The Murdoch press is a prime, and notorious example.

At the time, that was a centrist adminission of how much bullshit is flogged to a gullible public to 'manufacture consent' at whatever price to the facts.

After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa ``traitor provinces`` but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It's not clear what erosion may have suffered ``MLNV`` (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6.

He wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film, establishing himself as a cool-headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him (``You are most gracious my liege`` - ``I assure you your highness, it won't happen again``), despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance. Even with this mask, Jafar's villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer, particularly in the opening sequence, where Jafar displays no remorse in sending Gazim the Thief to his death in the Cave of Wonders, simply proclaiming that ``Gazim was obviously less than worthy`` in a rather dry tone of voice. The deleted song ``Humiliate the Boy`` also establishes Jafar as an emotional sadist, getting a laugh out of seeing ``another fellow's dreams turn into nightmares one by one`` and treating the Genie in an especially harsh manner (one only has to watch the video, a link to which is provided, in which Jafar viciously tugs the genie's beard several times whilst shouting orders like ``Do as I say``). It is not until Jafar gains control of the Genie's lamp that he fully shows his true colors, becoming even more arrogant and short-tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the Sultan (``Don't talk back to me you big blue lout! You are to do what I order you to do! Slave). It is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall, as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie, unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJafar is usually shown to be somewhat comedic and plucky (giving a slightly human side to his usual malevolence, a trait not often seen in Disney villains), even in his times of evil and cunning, proclaiming ``Ewww...`` when contemplating decapitation. This, however, doesn't keep Jafar from having a sub-par sense of humor himself, spurting several puns in a row while keeping Aladdin and his friends from getting the lamp during the film's climax (``Your time is up!``, ``Don't toy with me!``, ``Things are unraveling fast now, boy!``, ``Get the point?``, ``I'm just getting warmed up!``) This comical humor does not carry over in the film's direct-to-video sequel, which aimed to make Jafar more sinister and ruthless, though it is referenced in Jafar's role in ``Hercules and the Arabian Night``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCan't think of a citation for that last sentence so maybe we should leave that out.

161116707.0,"SDATA_0 :  SDATA_0 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as ``keep`` regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form ``keep, I believe this subject is notable`` are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  `  : EDATA_0  : EDATA_0",dev,0
