Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  NEWLINE_TOKENIt is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS MENTION IN ISRAELI SOURCES. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPropaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only just like the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.NEWLINE_TOKEN“THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE, THE ARTS, AND KNOWLEDGE ARE THE ENEMIES OF ALL MANKIND!”  : EDATA_4",dev,0

339067325.0,"SDATA_4 :  ` January 2010 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“This section was started with discussion of ``bias in favor of Darwin's theory`` raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI certainly agree with that. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?NEWLINE_TOKENKind Regards, M.   01:05, 21`  : EDATA_4",dev,0

553425186.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::BTW, /where/ a particular critic is published or quoted is 'technically' only relevant (for verifiability) as far as the 'reputation' of the publication. Time and Womens Wear Daily are equally 'reputable sources', in the very sense I mean, as in that if either one publishes an interview with a major personality you can be pretty damn sure the person actually said the quotes. Writing ``Bob said 'I love it!'`` is a 'statement of a fact directly known to the author'. The interviewer saw and heard the interviewee say it, unless they are lying, the publisher let them get away with it, and the interviewee didn't scream bloody murder. Doubtful for either of those magazines.NEWLINE_TOKEN::The same critic's interview published on the fansite 'www.ilovebooks.com' fails that test (His published quotes are 'notable', but not 'verifiable'). In the little known 'Collection of My Interviews of Book Critics', written by 'Joe English Professor, Ph.D.' and published by Oxford University Press it definitely passes due to scholarly review.NEWLINE_TOKEN::OTOH, the interview quotes of an 'unnamed Palestinean' as part of an article in Time about the West Bank pass the verifiability test, though 'notability' of the quotes would depend on context. The same article in Womens Wear Daily does not, as they are much less likely to have fact checked it as thoroughly, which is needed for something such as that. It's much more plausible that the WWD author spent his entire 'in country' time sitting in the hotel bar writing a fake article and got away with it. Get it?NEWLINE_TOKEN::It's also unlikely, TBH, that Bloom would have said anything different if he was asked the exact same questions, in the same order, by the same person, in the exact same context except that the interview was for Time. Also, a formal 'review' by him would have said the same thing....just in better language.NEWLINE_TOKEN:As far as a book review by a professional, which is a 'direct statement of opinion by an expert', where the critic is published is a function of his 'reputation', not vice versa. Peeps write reviews for Time instead of The Podunk Daily because of their reputation, and the fact they are published in Time is just an indication of that.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Say that famous reviewer retires, and only writes occasional reviews for his hometown paper, The Podunk Daily, to 'keep his hand in'. They are just as usable, though it might be harder to verify that (you can assume a reviewer published in Time is a 'good' one, you have to check the other one out).NEWLINE_TOKEN:  `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

The two members that I mention were both from the 1960's, and one was a president. It is too easy to think of eugenics as belonging to the past or to another country.

405456665.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what ``disagree`` means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that ``folk costume``, ``folk dress``, ``national dress``, ``ethnic costume``, ``traditonal dress`` etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to ``folk costume`` or ``folk dress`` for the reasons cited above, but ``folk costume`` should not be a subset of ``national dress`` since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::By the way, the use of narrow use ``costume`` to mean ``theatrical costume`` is about as common as the use of ``dress`` to mean ``a woman's garment with a skirt``.  Both ``costume`` and ``dress`` have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  ``Clothing`` is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing ``Medieval clothing`` vs. ``Medieval costume`` vs. ``Medieval dress``.  And ``folk clothing`` is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, ``costume`` and ``dress`` are both preferred terms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::OED definitions are pertinent here: NEWLINE_TOKEN::::*COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::*DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say ``Folk costume`` is more accurate.  But I personally prefer ``Folk dress``, and I'd choose that over ``National dress``. -   `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

Here's what I removed. ...  NEWLINE_TOKEN:==Why 'Neo'-Darwinism==NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN:There is no one theory of Neo-Darwinism. The term is commonly used to refer to currently accepted mainstream ideas about evolution  , which cannot properly be called 'Darwinian' since Darwin's hypothesis regarding the origin of the variation necessary for natural selection, which he called Pangenesis, is no longer accepted by most geneticists.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Darwin recognised several problems with his theory, which he was unable to solve. In 1859, when his seminal book The Origin of Species was published, nothing was known of DNA or genes, and very little about cell biology. He could not conceive of Mutation which is now considered to be the source of novel material in the evolutionary process. His theory of Pangenesis, which he published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, hypothesised that Gemmules, his imagined forerunners of genes, carried information to the next generation by accumulating in the germinal cells or zygotes and that they changed in response to use or disuse of the organs from which they were thrown off. Though Darwin did not acknowledge any debt to Lamarck, this was essentially a form a Lamarckism, now rejected by most mainstream scientists.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Despite the title of his book The Origin of Species Darwin did not explain speciation, and he recognised a problem. For natural selection to produce adaptive evolution, he considered that the changes in individual organisms that were the material for selection had to be small. Only then could successive generations move towards an optimum state for any trait. If the changes, whatever their origin, were too large, then they would constantly 'overshoot' the desirable optimum, producing offspring that were forever badly adapted. This requirement for small change or Gradualism seemed destined to lead to stabilising selection, which was inconsistent with the observed fact that different species have somehow broken away and become very different from each other.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Darwin also assumed that characteristics were the result of 'blending inheritance'; the mixing of contributions of both parents. In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, he presents abundant evidence from animal and plant breeders, as well as common experience with human offspring, suggesting that in general some sort of average of the two parents was produced, though he recognised sports or throwbacks as the exception that was to him a mystery. He could not see how such blending might lead to anything other than the gradual dilution of variation, to the point of eventual elimination, which conflicted with the possibility of speciation. >NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:== History and Useage ==NEWLINE_TOKEN:The Ukranian I. I. Schmalhausen used the term in his seminal work Factors in Evolution which his colleague Theodosius Dobzhansky, described by Steven J. Gould as the central contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis described as very important to the synthesis. He says, (p175) ``The Lamarckians based their theory on the premise of an already existing individual adaptability and did not examine its origin while the Neo-Darwinians regarded it as unimportant since they assumed that the results of individual adaptability, being non-inheritable, have no evolutionary value.`` He also says, (p198), ``Unfortunately, the more recent advances of genetics have promoted the spread of neo-Darwinian concepts. Morover, adaptive modifications generally have not been accorded any place among the factors of evolution.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The widely used school textbook Biology a Functional Approach says: ``The Darwinian theory reappraised in terms of modern genetics is sometimes called neo-Darwinism.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Richard Dawkins uses the term to when referring to current ideas, saying ``that idea means quite a complicated mixture of things`` but does not explicitly distinguish it from the ideas of the modern synthesis .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Steven J. Gould, one of the most published evolutionary theorists of modern times, used the term neo-Darwinism frequently .

It was recently pointed out to me that some of my editions to the big bang entry were inappropriate, because an entry for a subject is the place to support the subject, not to tear it down. The suggestion was made to me that I move my proposed editions to where they would be appropriate, in ``non-standard cosmology`` entries. I now make this suggestion to you. If you seek to criticize iridology, you should not do it in the entry meant to explain and support iridology. Perhaps you can make an entry titled ``non-standard iridology`` or maybe even ``fringe theories about iridology`` if you want to challenge the mainstream iridologists.

This was dismissed as being a fringe viewpoint. This I disagree with. I'd first note the lack of criticism of St. Francis and Franciscans, demonstrating a lack of NPOV (something commented on by others), and also a conflict of interest in Marauder40 deleting these comments, where he seems to act with a conflict of interest, being a devoted Catholic and member of a Secular Franciscan order, as noted in his bio.

He therefore draws on his own background in critiquing the Franciscans, and is a recognised scholar.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf this particular comment, the origin is not Joseph McCabe alone, he draws from ``The Middle Ages`` by Professor James Westfall Thompson, where on page 674 he says ``With wealth the old familiar evils that had corrupted the older orders corrupted the Franciscans and Dominicans too``. He also draws upon the writings of Father Hoetzappel, a historian of the Franciscan order, not to mention his own pertinent background and experiences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn this light, I consider the comment I introduced earlier as appropriate to Wikipedia, providing a range of views and importantly, criticism from a recognised scholar.

Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice. Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==   : EDATA_4",dev,0

I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN# Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid ``academic phrasing`` in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example ``social cost`` or ``social production``.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Speaking of ``social production`` it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by ``proportions of social production`` you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between ``economic worth`` and ``social worth`` which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between ``social product`` and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN# ``Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people.`` - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really ``inherently`` controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern ``working class people``. They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of ``economic worth`` can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question ``what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?`` is not obviously or directly related to the question ``what was the social power of capital in 1840?``.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Some ideas for expansion: ``Theoretical problems`` sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). ``Wage price series`` can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a ``real price`` is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide ``snapshot`` views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better.

Also, maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from, or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference. Then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of UNC lacrosse. Could also have a section of UNC's present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with UNC lacrosse.

My experience is limited since I am new to wikipedia, hence I would like to invite the admins to take the necessary counter-measures. NEWLINE_TOKENBack to the article, the Greek or Vlach toponym are totally superfluos, since neither of these languages is official in Albania, nor there is any indigeneous greek or vlach speaking community in the city. So far not a single source has been brought to  attest the countrary. Let alone the sentence of being centre of greekness is at least ridicuous. As une user has written precedntly ``The city itself is almost entirely Albanian populated with the Greek minority living in the adjacent villages(namely Dropul, Droviani etc.). The city itself gave birth to a number of Albanian nationalists, artists and politicians(most notorious being Enver Hoxha). The city itself was built under the Ottoman period and shows architecture typical of the Ottoman Empire and formed part of what was unofficially recognized as Arnavutluk. Before then it was nothing more than a fortress that from the 14th century onwards passed from one Albanian tribal lord to another.`` As it is seen here  in the diary of John Cam Hobhouse of his travels with Lord Byron in 1810s Gjirokastra is refered as a  city inhabited by Turks e.i. moslems. But seems to me that no one here is interested on the truth but only on their fascist ultranationalist agendas.

No, ``when the shared consensus on a value disappears`` the value does not ``always`` disappear under ``all circumstances``. It may only disappear for the two parties who previously agreed. A gold coin may have had no value for the victims of the Titanic at the time the Titanic went down. That gold coin always had value till today and will have value in the future. Adam Smith regarded a bushel of wheat as a stable measure of real value. Every daily inflation-indexed or daily deflation-indexed national currency (that means it is possible in all currencies - bitcoin is not included here) is a perfectly stable in unit of real value and will always be that for a indefinite period of time during all levels of inflation and deflation. Wow!! now I have revealed the perfectly stable unit of real value to you. Well, it was possible since 1927 when the ILO institutionalized the CPI. You cannot group bitcoin with the dollar and euro: the last two are money. Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is a medium of exchange like the dollar and euro, but it is not money: it is not a monetary unit of measure: no financial reports are prepared in bitcoin.

106199800.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=====NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Wikipedia article on Federal Vision shows a strong flavor of bias, because it does not clearly describe Federal Vision's distinctive, and often contested, meanings for various Christian theological words and phrases of long standing; and because it omits an adequately clear summary of the most common criticisms of FV.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe neutrality of the article can be strengthened in at least two ways. One way is clarify the new definitions that certain Federal Visionists have created for certain established theological terms and phrases. For example, the Federal Vision's view of ``covenant objectivity`` results in a category of person some have called the ``unbelieving Christian`` or ``unsaved Christian``, which most evangelicals regard as an oxymoronic statement. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFederal Visionists assert a belief in election, but subdivide the elect between elect who are granted an additional grace of perseverance and thus persevere in their faith unto eternal life, as opposed to a different category of the elect who are not granted a special grace of perseverance by God, and as a result apostasize from the Christian faith and are eternally condemned to hell. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe phrase ``obedient faith`` has been adopted from controversial CRC pastor Rev. Norman Shepherd, and is used to signify that one is justified not by faith alone (that is, faith in Jesus Christ and the Gospel, considered apart from its subjective ethical influences), but by the consequent actions of ethical obedience to God's will which result from faith.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis brings us to a second way to make the Wikipedia article neutral, which is to add a clear section on basic criticisms of Federal Vision. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe link section addresses some of these, but there ought to be material in the body of the article itself that enumerates and clearly describes the most common criticisms of Federal Vision. E.g., Federal Vision has been criticized as not being properly described as ``evangelical`` (since ``evangelical`` denotes a Protestant insistence on the necessity of individual conversion), in light of its teaching of presumptive baptismal regeneration, and continual criticism (and sometimes mockery) of American evangelicalism's emphasis on the encessity of conversion. In this sense, it appears to be more akin to high Anglicanism, which is non-evangelical. The claim that it more faithfully represents the thought of John Calvin is disputed by many familiar with Calvin's theology.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN( )`  : EDATA_4",dev,1

For example, the lede described EJ as an adviser to Presidents FDR and LBJ, but the main text did not fully support this statement, relating rather that (a) for a time, his work was read with interest by some in the Roosevelt White House, and (b) he informally advised Johnson while he was in Congress. There were also phrases that seemed a bit loosely applied, and/or POV in nature (e.g., describing FDR's fiscal policy as ``hyperactive`` I think fails the POV test). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm further troubled by the statements about EJ's purported anticipation of the rural S&L; crisis, but not sure I quite know enough on the subject to actually make changes (I've instead requested sourcing).  Two points of concern: (a) I'm not sure how relevant it is to predict in the mid-1970s a credit crunch that does not arrive until a decade later (also, to what extent his line of reasoning was accurate  i.e., did the cruch arrive due to factors that he identified, or for quite different reasons?), (b) the article currently relates that the credit crunch ``resulted in the savings and loan industry's troubles throughout farm country``.  Is this accurate, or would it be closer to the truth to say that it resulted ``from`` the S&Ls;' troubles?

Its a smaller change to have all words with the ``r`` sound at the end in ``er`` form, then changing them all to  the ``re`` form.

I am contacting you, somewhat at random, as I noticed you have closed several AFD recently and as you are generally regarded as a good admin. The page  has been serving as a de facto noticeboard for people proposing and following AFD's on a particular topic: 9/11.  To an extent has begun to broaden its focus into politically related articles in general, serving as an AFD conservative noticeboard. Among several recent examples, the Yellowcake forgery nomination was listed there as it went on AFD. This sort of private noticeboard strikes me as quite counter to the ideal collaborative and neutral spirit of AFD. I doubt, for example, that we would permit a WP:AFD noticeboard on topic X. Isn't that what AFD itself is for? So, I personally take issue with a user-space page which is serving the same role of co-ordinating editors with a particular outlook.

After the article published on Le Monde newspaper , it's been recalled on the French talk page that hiding specific dimensions of a topic is considered WP:POV .

For the matter, this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio, Europe 1 . This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version.

Putting aside if one considers this a credible offer or possible. The clearest example of this (again putting aside what one thinks of it) was again by the Iraqi government on December 11, 1975 putting full page advertisements in numerous Western newspapers (The New York Times, Toronto Star, and Le Monde) asking any Iraqi Jews who left Iraq to feel free to return to Iraq (again putting aside whether one views this as a genuine offer or not). This page is sourced  and is done by someone with a Ph. D.  Also the reality of the existence of in particular the Iraqi government advertisements of December 11, 1975 (calling for any Iraqi Jews to come back to Iraq) is admitted even by ideologically Zionist website [www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/discredit.html] which state that pro-Zionist groups ``scoffed at`` the Iraqi offer. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis info should be included and the sources are valid (written by a Ph. D.), especially if writings of the ``JCPA`` is included as the JCPA is an obviously partisan think-tank associated with the Israeli Likud party in particular (so any noting of the legitimate sources I'm providing, putting aside the pro-Zionist source corroborating in particular the 1975 Iraqi government advertisements, being partisan to one side should also then have the ``JCPA`` links and writings removed for partisan reasons). This info should be included in the ``compensation`` section as it by itself (the offer, whether one believes it or things like it are genuine or not) would be an offer of not just ``compensation`` but a return to where one originally came from in the first place.

Whenever anyone states a clearly obvious uncontested fact in Wiki, which is what about 50% of Wiki is, unless someone can show the logical fallacy of the statement being presented as fact, it is usually not removed due to lack of documentation.  For example, if I write that the Dravidian culture of India is centered towards the Southern end of India, I generally won't document it, as it is already a well known fact amongst those who know about India.  Now if I were wrong about this in an article, then perhaps someone would first point out specifically that they have heard that the Dravidian culture is centered in the North of India, and could I please document my claim that it is centered in the South.

Although to a general lay public, Freud, Jung and Adler are often seen as the ``Big Three`` of psychoanalysis, in the strict sense, only Freud was a psychoanalyst.  Jung was an analytical psychologist and Adler an individual psychologist.

It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

(Also, you don't seem consistent since you didn't move the articles of the other Hungarian stations.)NEWLINE_TOKEN# ``Budapest keleti pályaudvar`` is incorrect in Hungarian. The city name itself is never a part of the name of railway stations, unless it's the only station of the city.

The link between tobacco and cancer was first hypothesized as a carcinogen in 1898, with the first animal experiments finally producing demonstrable evidence for the link in the 1930s.  The scientific consensus for lung cancer from tobacco first formed in the 1950s. Because of the constant ``doubt is our product`` propaganda from the tobacco industry, the public did not fully become cognizant of the risk until thirty years after the science was solid. And throughout this last century, tobacco industry funded studies appeared in peer-reviewed journals without proper disclosure, twisting and distorting the science at every possible level.

312627370.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about ``politically correct noncompetitive recreation``), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of ``corruption`` were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's ``unofficial source,`` who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEqually embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short ``Articles suggest...`` paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (``There have been a number of criticisms...``) which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is ``efficient.`` And move on.   M32`  : EDATA_4",dev,1

595845967.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENThis block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a ``diatribe``; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to ``justify`` my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as ``diatribe``, an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that  broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )`  : EDATA_4",dev,0

I have seen several times editors leaving WP claiming WP is/was broken beyond repair or something. I think such a claim is fundamentally wrong.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe way I see it, Wikipedia is a complex dynamical system, with rather nontrivial internal interactions of a huge number of contributors and bureaucrats.  Moreover, it is probably governed by certain laws under certain assumptions. There is a microscale (individual contributors editing certain articles), a mesoscale (groups of editors pushing their agenda in a group of articles) and a macroscale, the whole project evolving over years. On a microscale nothing matters. You, me can join, can leave Wikipedia, very few would even notice. In a matter of days, may be months names and contributions would be forgotten, the project would however survive. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat is interesting to me is that your morsels capture certain dynamics on a mesoscale quite well. And that made me wonder if you can share your thoughts over the future dynamics of the whole project here. Not just some subproject, not just over the next few days, but the whole Wikipedia over years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat brings me to the next question. How can one claim the system of Wikipedia is broken? Do they understand the dynamics of Wikipedia better than me so that they see something that defies/breaks some natural laws? I understand that they joined the project to help it achieve a certain goal (whatever they set in their mind) and after a failure to do so, they leave frustrated. But to claim Wikipedia is broken? Why? What do they see that I do not? To me it is akin to claiming that the nature is broken after seeing that foxes eat rabbits. What do you think about that? (  )  : EDATA_4",dev,0

The reasons given for deletion do not fall into the normal criteria for template deletion listed at the top of this page. A simple review of the templates would have shown that any alleged accessibility problems would need to be dealt with by a change in the behaviour of class=``abbr`` in MediaWiki, and are therefore not a topic for discussion here. That the nominator did not conduct the most simple research before nominating these templates for deletion is shown here: the fact that the TfD notice was not included within  tags led to the disruption of over 5000 articles, something which the nominator could have prevented had he thought to used simple discussion before even contemplating bringing the matter here. The disruption was completely predictable, given that the nominator chose to nominate more than 200 templates at once. The speedy keep does not imply any judgment on the accessibility questions raised in the discussion, which should be addressed in more appropriate fora.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:I have no objection to this being closed as keep, as there was consensus in that direction; but that was a provocative and insulting closure notice.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Firstly, it seems you're yet another person who has never actually bothered to read Wikipedia:Speedy keep, as your reasons for speedy keeping are at odds with what is written there. Secondly, it is not at all clear why TFD is not the place to discuss a vast collection of templates whose only purpose is a gimmick that breaks web accessibility.

The Ayenbite that has been requested is another such instance.  (I think with Layamon the argument is sometimes that it the consonant became /y/ in his case, so modern editors feel like they're helping readers by making him more obviously Lawyerman.  All such things are excuses, though.)  Given that we are always already out of compliance with some browser or OS (e.g. does anyone know how far ``Windows MediaCenter`` or ``Longhorn`` are going to shove the old fonts out of whack), the kludge-y but best solution might well be to use an unusable typographical symbol (*, ^, #) and have a ``Key`` that indicates that that symbol was used for the yogh.

The idea was used as long ago as the American Civil War, and surely the concept was known in the Napoleonic wars as many prisoners were taken.  However, it is also likely that the designation of MIA was a product of the expected survival or capture of opposition.  In Pre-Napoleonic times most wounded soldiers died, and many would be killed rather than taken prisoner.

I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of ``He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s.`` Adding ``to some of the generation`` should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in ``Inertia Coupling`` or ``Alexander Abian`` are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place ``to come as you are,`` becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

No, I do not feel that your suggestions at the PR are entirely helpful as far as what I intend for the article, but my comment re: the Novels WikiProject dealt entirely with what I saw on the talk page after I had posted my request for reviews.  It's not the same project with the same focus that I remember, which is why I ended up removing my post.  Again, this had nothing to do with you or your curriculum vitae.  Since we are now discussing it, however, I'm sure you do a very good job in most of your Wiki endeavors.

Would that be helpful at all?  The Red Badge of Courage is of high importance in the canon of Am lit and needs to be done right. I was quite careful in the GA review before passing it. There is perhaps room for development regarding themes, but what's there is presented succinctly and is easy to read. Quite honestly I'm tempted to take the monstrosity I've created with The Sun Also Rises and simplify following the example of Red Badge. Anyway, thanks for the pie - I even have a chair on my page, so I can sit and eat pie and fight with the AN/I crowd )   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHey, no fair!  Truthkeeper got a pie and I only got a lousy cupcake? )  Seriously, though (and this goes to both Sadads and Truthkeeper), thank you both for your input on Red Badge.  The problem with such important  and, quite frankly, brilliant  novels like Red Badge and The Sun Also Rises is trying to strike that perfect balance between readability and encyclopedic value.  It's so difficult to get just right, and as a result no two novel-related articles are ever the same.  Perhaps that's why a project like WP:NOVELS will never be sustainable in quite the same way as WikiProjects dedicated to battleships, films, or even fungi.  A few years ago when I tried to resurrect the project, it was unfortunately a waste of time for me, personally; while my interests even then were leaning toward classic literature, it seemed that many members were only occupied with popular literature.  We could never seem to organize ourselves, and it seems that continues today.  That, and I admittedly seem to work better by myself.  I apologize for my shortness with you; I know you meant well, but my high standards clouded that fact.  I'm sorry if this episode may have hastened a wiki-break on your part.

695677413.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy concern is that an entire article on Billy the Kid was removed for no valid reason. That article not only contained my contributions, but the contributions of others. It contained the most detailed bibliography on Billy the Kid offered yet on Wikepedia. It also included 147 detailed citations. There is no valid excuse for removing that article and substituting the mess that is there now. Blocking me for real or imagined infractions is one thing. Destroying the article that I, and others, had worked long and hard on - and replacing it with an absolute piece of junk - is quite another. You have done extensive work on Wikipedia's Wyatt Earp article. How would you feel if all of your efforts were deleted? What was done to my last version of the Billy Kid article is nothing less than criminal - and that crime is against Wikipedia and all of those unselfish people who have tried to make it a reliable source. The joke is, I considered myself finished with the Billy the Kid article when it was suddenly removed. Now if you, and the others at Wikipedia ``sincerely value your expertise. Wikipedia needs knowledgeable authors like you,`` as you say. You will restore my last version of the article. Here is my good faith offer: If Wikipedia will restore that article at the point where I last left it, I promise that I will not go near it again. I look forward to the work that your expert editors can do to correct the ``encyclopedic tone,`` and encourage that effort. I also look forward to submissions and improvements to this article by other Wikipedians. Please note that I have claimed to ``own`` the Billy the Kid article. All I was trying to do was to provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from. The quickest way to do this is restore the article as it was when it was moved. I have no intention of trying to get it back to that point, by correcting the absolute mess that is up there right now. I trust you and all the forthright editors at Wikipedia to correct the ``encyclopedic tone`` that you consider lacking. I would also appreciate the removal of those tags that have suddenly appeared at the top of articles I contributed to on Bat Masterson and Luke Short. They suddenly appeared on the Masterson and Short articles at the exact same time my last version of Billy the Kid. It is not that I should be treated differently because of my credentials in the Wild West History field ... the fact is that no one should have to be treated that way. This is childish behavior from those who don't have the best interest of Wikipedia involved. I won't bother asking to be unblocked ( which, of course, I should be ) since I have to leave the clowns that put that block in place something they can brag about ... as in the vein of ``Well, I guess we showed him!`` Now the time has come to show everyone else what Wikipedia really stands for. The place to start is with your good faith restoration of my Billy the Kid article exactly as it was when I last worked on it. Unless I am specifically asked for clarification, on some historical point on the Kid,by you, and others involved with Wikipedia, I have absolutely no intention of doing anything further on the subject of Billy the Kid.

312267358.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real ``edit conflict`` I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - ``A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.`` - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of ``Welsh nationality`` (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his ``explanation`` on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza8  : EDATA_4",dev,0

Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will ``fail open`` and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network. Furthermore being a tree network a lot of traffic will tend to cluster on the center of the tree (the impact of this can be reduced by making those parts of the network higher speed or by using techniques like port trunking).`  : EDATA_4",dev,0

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

It has very reliable sources just as you mentioned  books(mostly QURANIC VERSES, HADITHS, tafsirs), and very nominal amount of personal opinion (less than what some of the articles of wikipedia have).NEWLINE_TOKEN::I am more than happy to argue with you regarding wikiislam's credibility. BUT PLEASE DON'T FEED ME THIS NONSENSE THAT WIKIISLAM IS NOT RELIABLE OR NOTAB_TOKENLE simply because it says something that's considered to be politically incorrect. Learn a little something here. WIKIISLAM, LIKE WIKIPEDIA, is just a conveyor of information through reputed sources. Try to comprehend my point. I'm not so eloquent a person!Barry `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

Second, to focus attention not only on the messages and goals of Americanist leaders, but also on the ideas, views, and concerns of ordinary Americanists, as reflected through letters Americanists wrote to each other, to national magazines and conservative periodicals, to Robert Welch and the John Birch Society, to Dr. Fred Schwarz and the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade (CACC), and even to J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.  Third, to address some of the stereotypical views of the Birch Society and its allies – primarily that Americanists were vicious racists and anti-Semites akin to George Lincoln Rockwell and the American Nazi Party – and to explore what were in fact ambiguous and nuanced attitudes toward African Americans, Jews, anti-Semitism, racism, Zionism, and the civil rights movement.  Fourth, to demonstrate that many of the members of the Birch Society, attendees at the CACC’s “Schools of Anti-Communism,” and listeners to Clarence Manion and Dan Smoot shared a coherent political ideology, which they called “Americanism,” and saw it as their task to inform Americans about the benefits of free market economics, religion, states’ rights, and personal autonomy and the grave dangers of communism, liberalism, collectivism, atheism, and one-worldism.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis dissertation is divided into three parts: Part I traces the history of Americanism and Americanists between the early 1950s and the early 1970s.  Part II focuses on the critical period between 1958 and 1965, and uses letters and messages to determine what typical Americanists were thinking, saying, and doing during a time of great political and social change.  Part III examines the complicated Americanist views of racism, anti-Semitism, African Americans, and Jews.NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA link to it should be added into one of the sections on sources, whichever section is best.

When I originally put forth my version of MastCell and Nightscream's ``argument``, I was told I was not addressing the article, but just babbling on the issue. So, I defended myself that this is directly related to the article and its POV. Then, I was told, that somehow paraphrasing the argument used to push POV is somehow an ``attack`` on the editors!! And that I ``misattributed`` them. Fine, I'll deal with that later. Okay, so let me get this straight. People push a POV on an article. They use specific arguments to justify pushing their POV (the endless bickering over ``scientific consensus``, ``scientific community``, ``facts``, ``who is a scientist``, just read the last 3 years' discussion pages). I come onto this discussion page, and I point out how pathetic their arguments used to push their POV are. When I do this, I am told I am ``not addressing the article to improve it``, and that I'm ``attacking the editors`` (!!) and that if I continue to do this, I will be banned. Whatever. Nightscream said: ``I made none of the ``arguments`` you attributed to me, nor do I recall MastCell doing so either.`` But you said: ``It indicates that it is referring exclusively to those who follow the Scientific Method, and not any ol' Tom, Dick and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage.`` It does not take a ph.d. to figure out that by ``any ol' Tom, Dick, and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage`` you mean Duesberg, Perth, David Crowe, AIDS Wiki, and Virusmyth, and all the people associated with them. Hence, by your own words, you are saying that all these people, the ``Tom, Dick, and Harry``'s, are not following the ``scientific method`` and are thus not part of your ``scientific community``. And this is my point. You DEFINE anyone who rejects the hypothesis as necessarily not following scientific method, hence not a member of the scientific community, then claim there's 100% or near 100% agreement in the scientific community that HIV causes AIDS. It's a completely circular argument.   `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

Here they are!   NEWLINE_TOKEN* Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). I think ``...follows the adventures of...`` might sound better.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Dogs were considered but rejected because they were too close to cats in their hierarchal social organization, their pack and hunting lifestyles, and their territoriality. <``their`` is unnecessary in its second and third usage.NEWLINE_TOKEN* The company wanted her to write another series on animals just not about cats. This sounds slightly awkward, maybe a comma or two will make it flow more smoothly.NEWLINE_TOKEN* HarperCollins suggested dogs, but Holmes ``was reluctant...they guard their territories``.. Direct quotes need direct references. The statement about HarperCollins suggesting dogs especially needs a reference because it's referred to in the introduction.NEWLINE_TOKEN* ``the all-action excitement that the Erins love so much``. Same here.NEWLINE_TOKEN* the company then thought about horses knowing how Holmes also like them.. This sentence sounds a bit awkward, too (there's something grammatically incorrect in that sentence, methinks, but unfortunately, I'm too dumb to lay my finger on it myself).NEWLINE_TOKEN* ...the main inspiration for the series is Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages The great grammar mystery..again.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Lusa means black in Choctaw while Kallik means lightning or storm in Inuit.[2] Shouldn't Choctaw be linked to Choctaw language?NEWLINE_TOKEN* However, even there, Ujurak, who leads the journey feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. I think a comma after ``journey`` might make the prose smoother.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). Here, a serial comma is used, while in other examples such as Lusa, Kallik and Toklo and The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky and Spirits in the Stars. the extra comma is omitted. Either can be used, but it has to be consistent throughout the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN* The ``First Series`` section could be expanded quite a lot, I think (especially since the books don't get articles of their own yet).NEWLINE_TOKEN* Children's Literature picked up the environmental theme, it also commented themes such as ``commented on`` is probably better.NEWLINE_TOKEN* approach - three bears mdash;, mdash;, otherwise you crash..NEWLINE_TOKEN* ``She also cleverly deals with the theme of racism through a unique and honest approach - three bears of different color, different backgrounds and different beliefs turn to each other for survival and friendship``NEWLINE_TOKEN* Kirkus Review  thought ``Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery``; they also wrote that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot.[7] At first they're complimenting the book, and then they're ``also`` criticizing it. Maybe something along the lines of ...mystery``; however, they criticized the weakness of the plot and the excessive detail in character development and setting.NEWLINE_TOKEN* ``Other media`` could simply be ``External links``, no? )NEWLINE_TOKENAll in all, this article has a solid base and good references, but it needs much improvement to get there.

A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again.

According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit.

No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community.

According to our specific music notability guidelines, in order to justify an article, a band needs to fulfill any of these points. From what you wrote in that page, none of those points were fulfilled. If the band passes any of those points, you can include an article in Wikipedia. However, note that you will have to give references for such achievement, otherwise it will be speedy deleted (deleted within minutes of creation because of lack of notability). Even if it fulfills a point, note that Wikipedians can send the article to deletion (either because the notability reference is found to be fake or disputed, unverifiable or otherwise non notable), where wikipedians will discuss if the article is indeed notable by our guidelines, and decide whether it is deleted or not.

The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in 16th century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by  American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's  House of Usher released the previous year. A critical and box office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers. Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film. (more...) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_4",dev,0

697639821.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Re: ``Reverts`` ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello, Drmargi. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me, but in a very respectful, sophisticated manner. I've taken the time to review both articles you referenced, especially personal attacks. While what I said was not directed at any specific person, it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack. For that, I'd like to apologize. The reason I verbally came out swinging, so to speak, is because of misdirected frustration. There is an individual with whom I had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show, a show about which I'm almost as passionate as I am about Person of Interest, and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit (mind you, for good reason I now know), however, when this took place on another TV show's page, he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities. I had just started using Wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol, or even writing code (that is not the case anymore) Please do not misinterpret this, as I know I am the one in the wrong, and I am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which I somehow look like the victim. I just feel as though I needed to explain myself, and who better with whom to do so than the one of 4 users on Wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am well aware that the world will not end if the POI Season 5 info is not complete (lol). If I thought the world were to end, I wouldn't be on my computer. But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren't. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia's rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I've offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I'm glad I've learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I'm not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won't happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you for helping me to stay informed, so that I can continue to inform fellow TV Crime Drama fans.

If you notice, there was already a video clip of Dr. Holtzapple giving a presentation (reference #2 in present version), but in that clip he presents about a lot of things, whereas in the ones I added, he concentrates only on Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohols fuels.  What exactly made you think that this was a ``shameless pushing for publicity`` as you put it? The name of the company that is commercializing this technology (i.e., Terrabon, L.L.C.) does not appear ANYWHERE in those video clips, only the University LOGO of the College of Agriculture who were the ones who made the video clips.

The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.NEWLINE_TOKENAccording Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.

The ``topic sentence`` of the current, incompetently written paragraph on the Native American controversy is as follows: ``In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked a campaign controversy when it reported that Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directories from 1986 to 1995 listed Warren as a minority professor.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis topic sentence is unclear; a reader who reads it would not see what the controversy was about. Being listed as a minority is not controversial. The issue is that Warren 1) listed herself in a 2) minority-recruitment directory for law schools, on the basis of 3) undocumented claims to Native American ancestry. A competently written topic sentence would convey those three main points. Here is an example of such a topic sentence: ``In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked a campaign controversy when it noted that Warren had listed herself in a directory of minority law professors, used by law schools for recruitment purposes, despite the fact that she lacked any documented minority ancestry.`` That competently-written topic sentence states the controversy in a nutshell. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am willing to entertain any number of alternative topic sentences, including those that are unduly favorable to Warren. (I've given up on truly achieving NPOV for this article.) But I am not willing to abide unclear writing.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==='native ancestry'===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe current paragraph states that Warren's ``opponent Scott Brown speculated that she had fabricated a native ancestry to gain advantage in employment.`` At this point, the paragraph has not stated that she claimed to be Native American, so it is not clear what type of ancestry the term ``native ancestry`` refers to. I have tried to replace ``native ancestry`` with ``Native American ancestry,`` but have been repeatedly reverted.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==='Brown attacked Warren's ancestry'===NEWLINE_TOKENThe current paragraph states that Scott Brown issued attack ads that ``referred to Warren's ancestry.`` Whether made out of incompetence or malice, this statement constitutes a BLP violation. The statement indicates that Brown attacked Warren because of her ancestry or race. In reality, he attacked her for (allegedly) lying about her race to get ahead in the employment market.   `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere's a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science, and these two groups define it in very different ways. I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* The article ``Islamic science`` seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called ``Islamic science,`` which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines ``Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context`` (my emphasis).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* When historians wish to discuss scholars who don't follow traditional Islamic religious norms, while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement, while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRather than go this unhappy route, I propose an amicable divorce, removing the section on the History of Islamic Science (perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam) and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal, and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam.  `  : EDATA_4",dev,0

Simply put, this image doesn't illustrate this condition - we cannot see sticky mucus, or anything that would allow even a trained medical professional to make the diagnosis of CF just from looking at it. It's a touching image, and I understand why some may be attached to it - but as an encyclopedia, we need to base our decisions on more logical, objective standards. The end result of using the nebulizer picture in the lede is to make the article look amateurish - a picture of someone missing an arm is good for an article about amputation, but a picture of someone in a knee brace isn't really such an iconic example of a ACL tear that it'd be fit for the lede there.

I assume his reasoning for the undo was because the added info contained Gogs projected involvement in Final crisis (something that seems obvious, but has not been officially announced.  I removed all predictions and made the added info stick to only the facts given in JSA #14.  I did like the addition of the fact that the origin of Gog in pre-infinite crisis does not match this current version.  Now that the addition has been fixed, I hope that anyone who edits this adds two it and does not simply revert it.  If you do revert something, explain your reasoning so we don't get into and editing war.  Thanks   NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENIt is important to note that there have been three different origins for Gog. And all three characters made it to the main D.C. continuity.  His Hyperspace spanning, Time traveling, Multiverse jumping nature makes this character inherently hard to grasp when looking at the multiverse or even just the main DC universe. NEWLINE_TOKEN     NEWLINE_TOKENFirst, from the Kingdom Come timeline:  He Survived Kansas's destruction. Given powers by the Quintessence, he stole Superman and Wonder Woman's baby, went back through Hypertime killing Superman over and over again.  He was defeated in the Main DC continuity by Kingdom Come and main versions of the heroes.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe second version of Gog was basically a homage to the first, but without the tricky use of Hypertime and the Kingdom come continuity.  He survived Topeka's (only) destrucion.  He kept going back in time and advancing his work over and over.  This Guy made it into the pages of Superman comics.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe third version is the one in the current run of JSA.  He claimed he was got his power from Gog, Last God of the Third World.  And he complained about all of kansas being destroyed.  This origin actually resembles the first more than the second.  This makes it likely that he is from Earth-22, like the superman in JSA.  It is common for the new 52 Earths to resemble previous DC comic's Elseworlds, but have some differences.  It has already been shown that Earth-22 resembles Kingdom Come, but has some slight differences.  This explains the Kansas destruction being the same, but the change in his power source being from quintessence to a Third World god. Although time will tell if this is right, it does seem like the logical conclusion.  Someone can add this to the article when it is revealed in the pages of JSA.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo answer the above question, the Quintessence were fooled.  Phantom stranger thought that this man, who came out of the Kansas massacre, and started a Superman Church, would be a good representative of the values that the quintessence hold. But they were mistaken (gods a fallible in comics).  The guy snapped after getting the powers, went a little nuts, and killed Superman over and over.  The quintessence decided not to take back their power, but I am not sure if they explained why.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_4",dev,0

In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   Both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as Chicago and Toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.

This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked.

In the Apology, Plato distances himself from the inner circle.``  I believe this involves a misunderstanding of how Plato represents himself in the Apology.  I would not be prepared to say that Plato considered himself ``part of Socrates' entourage`` or Socrates' ``inner circle``; but that's only because it's not clear what whoever wrote this part of the article means by ``entourage`` or ``inner circle``.  Is it made clear elsewhere in Plato's dialogues who did belong to the ``inner circle``?  So far as I know, Plato never mentions an ``inner circle``.  But he certainly portrays himself in the Apology as one of Socrates' young devoted followers, in quite explicit terms in fact.

Eyes are organs that perceive light and forms a communication with the brain providing all the necessary data. The brain then processes the raw data and acts accordingly. An eye is a complex component of the human body comprising of various and sensitive minute parts. A transparent front part of the eye that acts a protection shield for the iris and pupil is cornea. Sensitivity, transparency and presence of immune cells make cornea a very special tissue. Cornea transplant surgery is an operational method in which a damaged cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue. It is very much admissible to consult a trained cornea surgeon in India and expert for successful cornea transplant surgeries. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCorneal TransplantationNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCorneal transplantation surgery, a process in which damaged corneal tissues are replaced, is also referred to as corneal transplant. It is one of the most successful organ transplantation surgeries in the world. Replacement of cornea can restore completely or partially lost vision, reduce pain and improve the efficiency of cornea. Also known as keratoplasty, the transplantation surgery is considered as successful sight saving operation for improves the optical quality of cornea. Some of the conditions that might require cornea transplantation include malfunctioning of cornea’s inner layers, keratoconus (bulging or change in shape of cornea), swelling in cornea and tissue growth in cornea. Occasionally corneal transplantation surgery is combined with various refractive surgeries, cataract surgeries and many such surgeries. Owing to technological developments and medical advancements, the number of corneal transplantation surgeries in India has increased subsequently providing sustained protection from cornea diseases.        NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDonor Corneal TissueNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCorneal transplantation includes replacement of damaged or diseased cornea by donor corneal tissue. A thorough evaluation of donor cornea is essential for the success of corneal transplantation surgery. Due to latest inventions in the field of medical science, today a single donor cornea is divided into 3 parts and is used in different patients for improving visual acuity. Detailed screening of human donor cornea during transplantation of cornea ensures successful transplantation surgery. However there are many risks involved in the surgery. These risks are relatively very small but they can cause hazardous effects if the surgery is not done under proper care. Some complications that could occur are bleeding, eye infection, increased sensitivity to light, rejection of new cornea, increased redness of the eye and many such dangerous complications.

I can tell the difference between an editor or admin ``out to get me,`` a few are on occasion, maybe, and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment. Often what I do can be hard to understand; if I'm brief, it's rejected as incoherent, if I explain thoroughly, it's tl;dr. And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often time-consuming; that is the best of writing, and it's hard to come by. One of my friends who, in the past, has written on the same topics as I do, but who is far more brief, has said that, sure, he's brief, but I'm more thorough, and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary (which, I'd say, is typically excellent) as it takes me to write my tome.) Ideally, it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia; writers *often* are too wordy, besides having points of view, making mistakes, and failing to reference claims, because they are writing from personal knowledge, and that's why they need editors, in real life as well as on Wikipedia. Editors and writers, real-world, are famous for conflict.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::On-line interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars, because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly high-bandwidth communication in person, mostly visual: this can't be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text, not even close (much more than a thousand times as much information per second). I've been ``conferencing`` on-line since the mid-1980s, and it was obvious then. If there is rapport failure, text may be interpreted through a hostile filter; hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text, instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings. Woonpton has done some reading in my history, and doesn't understand what she read (I think it's she). Others have done the same. If you look at Jehochman's warning to me that was the basis for my block last year, you could see a similarity with Woonpton's conclusions. Iridescent didn't make that the basis of the block, but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page. I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman, first with a userspace self-RfC (an new process, I must say, that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated, it was designed to be minimally disruptive; had I been as accused, I'd have been so advised, and I would not have been able to use the self-RfC for anything else), then by approaching Jehochman directly, and, out of that, a very solid working relationship has been formed. it was good even before we met in person. I never did address it with Iridescent, it seemed moot by the time I'd have been ready. Maybe someday. Thanks for dropping by, make yourself at home.

That means that Omega in this case is not final letter, because after Omega is placed too Sampi. Due to this fact, in this case God is not only local Ionian Alpha and Omega, because He is in this case too Somebody more - global Pan-Greek Alpha and Sampi. This fact should be acknowledged by all Christians that uses global Greek Alphabet, because in this case they can diminish God by excluding Him from full range of global Greek Alphabet. Ionians were justified by their unknowledge, and Jesus only adjusted Himself to their lower level of knowledge, calling Himself as local Ionian Beginning and End. Sho was placed between San and Qoppa and was only existing Greek letter not used by Greeks, but by Bactrians that adopted Greek alphabet. Comparison page is here.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm sorry, but ``Sampi`` was a kludge whereby a corrupt form of an archaic letter (formerly between Pi and Qoppa) was dragged in so that there would be 27 distinct symbols for the purposes of Isopsephy, while Sho was used in Central Asia to transcribe non-Greek languages. Neither of these symbols was ever used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing which is relevant for the Bible).  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Thus that would mean that Sampi was corrupted version of San, that is placed between Pi and Qoppa.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Probably it was (though there is still some debate over the matter).

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Because T-shaped alphabetic Sampi was introduced recently to Wikipedia, I think that it is in T-shape not corrupted, but fully fledged letter. For proof look into Sampi article to compare alphabetic T-Sampi and numeric C-Sampi. As you see, T-Sampi is more like russian П and too Greek PI, with addition of |, while C-Sampi is more like russian Э and too Greek LUNATE EPSILON, with addition of -. In this way T-Sampi should be primary, and C-Sampi secondary.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::It's a fully-fledged numerical symbol, but it wasn't a ``letter``, and it's not relevant to this article.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::T-shaped Sampi was really alphabetic letter with ss value, what is stated even in Greek alphabet article in obsolete letter section, but C-shaped Sampi is mainly numerical symbol derived from previous alphabetic symbol.

I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.NEWLINE_TOKENJerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)NEWLINE_TOKENAnd about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know).

The obvious mistake in the inadequate use of “prosecute” in the translation of the French Rabbinate can be analysed as an unconscious confession and denunciation of the falsification committed by the rabbinical ancestors.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENFor when he dictates his Commandments, the Eternal does not play with double meanings. Then here on the Sinai, the historical context is that of abandonment of circumcision until Gilgal. Therefore, only the bad faith of the fanatic victims of circumcision could twist the text in a misinterpretation that nobody should ever have imagined. For in order to restore circumcision, the rabbis were compelled to conceal the veritable meaning of the Second Com-mandment through falsifying the sense of the most sacred text of the Torah since directly written by God. The manipulation of the faithful is obvious. The sole attenuating circumstance would be pathological denial of the reality of the meaning of the Second Commandment, due to blind faith in Abraham’s commandment and to the deep psychological trauma its implementation provokes. It is indeed high time to put an end to it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENBesides, it is possible to word a hypothesis about the two versions of the Second Commandment, that which forbids circumcision and that which does not mention it. Until today, the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy has been considered warranted by the fact that the manuscript was found again buried in the temple of Jerusalem at the return from the exile in Babylon. But it is impossible that God should have varied in his formulation of the Ten Commandments; the Levite rabbis varied, not God. The redaction of the book of Deuteronomy has certainly been altered, truncated from the ban of circumcision. One must think that the discovery in the temple was a whole performance intended to warrant the return to circumcision. For the rabbis only knew the book of Deuteronomy, a book of rules of boring reading whilst the book of the Exodus was well-known to the people; it was the source of religious education and it was impossible to falsify it, only its interpretation could be changed. The version of the Book of the Exodus is both the authentic version and the one written at the intention of Nebuchadnezzar. Indeed, at the time of captivity, those who obeyed the divine will to respect the human body were likely still numerous. The Jews were divided about this point and the version of the Exodus enabled the rabbis to explain the fact to Nebuchadnezzar, while distinguishing the Jews from the Egyptians in order to avoid slaughter. The version of the Book of Deuteronomy was made up at the return from exile in order to warrant the new orthodox interpretation of the Second commandment of the Book of the Exodus.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENAbolishing the commandment of Abraham, the Second Commandment makes the right to physical integrity the first of the rights of man. One can even think that in the Third Commandment that comes right after this condemnation of circumcision:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“You will not invoke the name of the Eternal your God to support lie...” (20: 7, French Rabbinate),NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoses reproaches Abraham for having perjured saying that God would have ascribed him circumcision. A shrewd reader of the Bible, Mohammed took up this accusation in verses 4: 118-119 of the Koran (see below). For if God ever ordered Abraham circumcision, he forbade Moses to do it. Either it was not the same God or he changed his mind between both Alliances, or still Abraham lied and no God ever ordered circumcision.

Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally ``no one``. In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to ``no one``. It is impossible to say ``no one are dinosaurs``. It has to be ``no one is a dinosaur``. Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding ``none`` to ``no one`` does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that ``none`` is a synonym for ``nothing``.

I noticed that you are an active editor and participant to the article on Radio. Let me say congrats on the great work that you do. The reason why I am writing to you is to give a fair warning. A few days ago I made an edit or two to the article on the Marconi vs. U.S. case that essentially gave the radio patent to Tesla in 1943. The references I gave as you probably saw, were reliable and verifiable.  however as you also probably saw, I think I may have stirred the pot. Anything pinning Tesla to the underlying principles of radio is never acceptable to another editor on that article, Magnagr. So I wanted to warn you. I have fought him tooth and nail for over a year over this agonizing subject. I've reverted several of his unsourced edits, but he will not rest until he fulfills his agenda. His current user name is not even his first as he has several registered accounts on Wikipedia. I have a feeling that nationaliatic pride is also playing at hand here with him as I think he told me once that he was Italian. Hence, that is why he would want to only accredit Marconi as the sole contributor to radio. So it is just a warning. You and the others should be prepared to fight this with him as he will never stop. I gave up a long time ago. I have radio on my watch list so I will be following along and keeping my eyes open to the edits he makes. But you should as well pay very very  close attention what he does.

However, the high setting of standards does mean that even good faith creation of an article that cannot be referenced to a reputable third party source will fail (and there is the question of whether a subject that cannot provide those references is of sufficient stature to be included.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I said, perhaps the best course of action to take is to read through the WP help pages (Help:Contents/Editing Wikipedia, Help:Contents/Links and especially Help:Contents/Policies and guidelines are good places to start) and see if you can create an article in your userspace which conforms to the guidelines.     : EDATA_4",dev,0

On the 26th of august the following statement was removed from the Foresters Falls, Ontario article: Foresters Falls is now a small community having digressed significantly since the invention of motorized transport. NEWLINE_TOKENThis information was removed without any explanation. Because it is a factual peice of information I replaced it (aug 28th) and for safety sake put the book I had gotten it from as a referance. I explained my edit as ``Facts are facts``. I imagined that the matter would end here. Why would anyone insist on its removal after this point? The next day I saw that it had been removed again by the same user who explained ``if it's a fact cite a reliable source``. A simple enough request. I thought I had already done that but no matter. I renamed referances as sources, re-added the sentance again, explained this and left it. Within the hour my edit had been reverted and a message left on my user board saying ``Your change to the page Foresters Falls, Ontario was determined to be unhelpful, and has been reverted``. Needless to say I was a bit upset. Who determined this? who's POV about Foresters Falls is more important? What criteria are being used? I understand that the statement is not the most important ever but it certainly doesn't detract from the article. I have been attempting to have the user ArmadilloFromHell explain why he insists on it's absence but he is being very stubborn and will not answer my questions.

But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes ``congestion``, which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the ``pain and tenderness`` of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.)  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurther, the term ejaculate, like the earlier ``release semen`` (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply ``release``), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain ``release``, or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).NEWLINE_TOKEN 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)`  : EDATA_4",dev,0

The redlinks link to clearly notable topics that deserve articles and have considerable scholarship; thus they are likely to be created. Redlinking, in general, is a good think: and encourages continued article creation. This has happened with the JFCooper articles, and I am sure it will happen with the Trollope articles. Moreover, a redlink is a useful navigational tool, in that it shows people where we cannot help them yet. If you don't remember 4-5 years ago, one of the biggest growth tools to encourage new editors was read links (read Wikipedia:Red link). But precisely this kind of overreach on policy, to make Wikipedia look complete and not a WP:Work in Progress prevents new people from finding ways to contribute - and discourages people from making good faith attempts at contributing.
