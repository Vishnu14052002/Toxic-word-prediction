I do plan to expand the Papakating Creek article and think (a) there are more resources for such content and (b) there a larger exposition on course, watershed, hydrology, geology content would be more appropriate. Further, as MOS eschews short sectionsMOS:PARAGRAPHS says ``Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading``, it would be inadvisable per the MOS layout guidelines vis-à-vis their application for GA evaluation to start creating short sections.

Tipler; also available here``. Whereas the version before was properly cited: ``David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: ``The Ends of the Universe,`` with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an ``eminent physicist`` in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdditionally, while Jeffro77's ``fringe`` claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an ``eminent physicist`` in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, ``The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,`` Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal).

While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENChams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book ``Historical Sight Through Thesprotia``, edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that ``The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek`` .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga.

In the article Jung Myong Seok I take issue with citations 11, 12, and  13.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN11 Is attributed to a French sociologist Ms Nathalie Luca.  Problem is the citiation page does not support the claim that JMS was a member of the Unification Church. Additionally there is an out of place British flag on the top of the citation page which does not fit CNRS country of orgin- France. Therefore,  I do not only doubt the authenticity of the citation but it does nothing to support the claim made in the body of the article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN12 Citation leads to a link titled Radio Australia with 5 poorly written sentences that describe a supposed historical timeline.  The article has no reference to primary sources AND does not even have a listed author.  It gives me the impression that someone robbed a page from Radio Australia and wrote whatever suited their needs. Furthermore, the information contradicts what was written in paragraph 3 of the JMS article.  Mr Jung was not fleeing justice but was carrying out missionary trips.  The sentence associated with this citation clearly portrays Mr Jung as a criminal on the run.   This is a shameful act of intellectual dishonesty and it is travesty to leave this libelous information posted with an inadequate citation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN13  The citation link is no longer available and can not be used to verify the statement in the body of the article.

You all call my editing behavior 'uncivil,' but I just call it 'being vocal' about the removal of valid material from Wikipedia. I will refrain from using 'strong language' in edit summaries in the future, including capital letters. You say that: ``This is persistent and entrenched behavior on your part that you don't seem to understand or want to change after many warnings and two blocks``  I've never had any substantial warnings, only the two expedited blocks. You say that I should ``accept the rules`` when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it. Any way that you put it, strong wording in edit summaries is not a valid reason to perma-block people, as short sentences like that can easily be taken out of context.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Regarding my claims of censorship and vandalism in the above-mentioned edit summaries: I'm not sure what else to call it if not censorship and vandalism...I suppose I could always call it ``the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles,`` but that would be whitewashing the issue. For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you? Some kind-of phantom clause in WP:BLP is constantly cited to try to justify the removal of this information even though this information is currently found in thousands of other articles with no problem at all.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:When I wrote ``Revery [sic] Jayjg's idiotic edit...`` in an edit summary for removing Category:Ethnic nationalism from the White nationalism article I only made that statement because the very first sentence of the article said ``White nationalism (WN) is a form of ethnic nationalism...``  thus the removal of said category seemed rather idiotic in my opinion since the first sentence of the article obviously confirmed that particular category. Jayjg then changed that first sentence (he provided no source for this edit) and removed the category. I never called Jayjg idiotic, only that particular edit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Since everything I write on here seems to be misconstrued, taken the wrong way, and wrongfully considered 'uncivil' and/or 'aggressive' (what is and what is not 'civil' and 'aggressive' is highly POV and a matter of opinion, by the way), I plan to edit  and remove any and all information that could be considered 'offensive' or 'uncivil'  I am going to bring the page down to the basics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Truthfully, I try my best to avoid getting caught up in all of these Wiki-politics, personal vendettas, petty edit wars, childish games, etc.; I am part of no group/cabal here, I stick to myself and mind my own business, and improve and expand Wikipedia as best I can. However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages. I would like to discuss these issues (and I always try to leave a good edit summary), but whenever I try to discuss these issues the response I so often get is one or two bogus sentences and the mindless repetition of a bunch of Wikipedia essays/guidelines (NOTE: NOT POLICIES) in an attempt to justify the censorious deletion/vandalism ``the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles.`` I haven't even been able to respond to this block since I am barred from editing the admin. messageboard; I was given no warning(s), and I was blocked before I even had a chance to defend myself regarding these spurious and overblown allegations.  `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

Honestly, I think that if people write it as a ``single``, they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.   `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1
226667609.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Statement ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of Ed, based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the ``conserv`` in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console Ed on his good faith attempt to serve the community again. Please do not wheel war over this block.

Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the ``Eastern German territories`` and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The 500.000 is big number, too big.

I suspect the reason is that, while it was once a radical college, it has become more conservative as the world has changed.  It was expected to become more radical, in the way that Antioch College did; but it didn't.  I think that the best solution is for outsiders to acknowledge Hillsdale's impressive history while still writing about it from an objective point-of-view.

Not to mention the government soldiers were committing massacres against Tamils in Northern Sri Lanka, the same time Tamils were massacred in Southern Sri Lanka around Colombo in 1983, which apparently is the ``capital`` of the ``entire`` Sri Lankan Country!? Plus what makes this all nonsense is that there are massacres against Tamils continuing today. The Sri Lankan military (armed by: India, Pakistan, Israel, USA, Great Britain, China, Australia, Russia) has already killed 100s of Tamils in Sambur in a Northern Town of Sri Lanka. I think that its time to admit all truths, because lying and denying won't get us anywhere. This is becoming a cat and mouse game. While you keep denying rape happened in 1983, tamils are being bombed by the Sri Lankan Military in Sambur right now! Come on!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

And what resources are you using for the USL all-time rosters? - I'd be happy to help.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere's a question: we previously discussed the ``clubyears`` infobox category for MLS players, and agreed that the clubyears listed should correspond with years played.  I'm going through various Chivas USA players right now, as you saw — finishing up the all-time roster for that club — and noticing how much confusion there has been on this issue over the years at Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI guess I'd propose a uniform standard, based on the way that MLSnet lists player stats (and based on the nature of the league): any season for which a player is rostered with a team is counted into the clubyears section.  For instance, if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus before the 2007 season begins, only 2006 is listed.  But if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus during the 2007 season (June, say), both 2006 and 2007 are listed as years for his Colorado tenure even if he didn't play a match for Colorado during 2007.  I think this is the best way to record years — and, happily, it conforms with the way the league's official site records stats.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have been thinking that we US-soccer editors might want to have some sort of official ``summit`` (or meeting, or whatever) on the talk page of the US/Canada WP:FOOTY taskforce...we could nail down guidelines on a number of tricky issues which are particular to American soccer, or at least somewhat unusual...like the exact way to list colleges, the way to list years, when to use accents in names, how to properly disambiguate American players, all kinds of things.

But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Greetings==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetings and welcome to wikipedia.

This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term ``cervical cap`` to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term ``cervical cap`` to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only ``cervical cap``).  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term ``cervical cap`` to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so ``cervical cap`` is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not attached to the title of ``cervical cap`` for this article.

My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Systems of punishment==NEWLINE_TOKENOn , we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced ``time out.`` In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on  saying, ``Good call.`` Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Prescription===NEWLINE_TOKENLanguage requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and ``misuse`` would soon render that language ineffectual.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWithin the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

NEWLINE_TOKENEnergy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc.

Throughout the conflict, Hamas repeatedly released messages that they had killed or captured Israeli soldiers, even though no Israeli soldiers were actually captured during the fighting. Also, Hamas sent messages in Hebrew to Israeli citizens' mobile phones warning: ``Rockets on all cities, shelters will not protect you.`` But Sean, Sceptic has added information from sources critical of Israel so I dont think he needs the lecture.

Also, Masdar numbers are as far-fetched as SOHR's. Really, they claim 200 Nusra(not counting other rebels) deaths in Shaykh Miskin by 10 of November. After that, we had over a month of a bloody battle, so likely the rebels suffered even more deaths, and they also said that hundreds more of Nusra fighters we're injured.

He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings.

544319478.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== NPOV required  ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article seems to me to lean more towards an ``heroic`` account of the war than an encyclopedic piece seeking a NPOV.  NEWLINE_TOKENFor instance the opening sentences of the section Soviet–Finnish relations and politics: NEWLINE_TOKEN``After the Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteer forces conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Russian border``NEWLINE_TOKENThe Finnish doctrine is embedded in its first sentence, tying ``Soviet involvement`` in the Civil War  with the idea that it necessitated a ``peace treaty``, and then using this muddled logic as if it were an a priori justification for Finnish military incursions into Russia. (Russian involvement was perhaps half that of the German involvement and both together accounted for about 10% of the protagonists. 35% more Finns died in the Civil War than in the Winter War)NEWLINE_TOKENOrthodox Finnish doctrine riddles the article, even though it contains all the information needed for an NPOV.  The account of Finnish independence for instance fails to mention that the Boshevik's policy was to grant autonomy, stating the event in heroic terms instead: NEWLINE_TOKEN``The outbreak of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire gave Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation's independence.``NEWLINE_TOKENKnowing the Boshevik's policy makes such doctrinal heroism ring hollow.NEWLINE_TOKENTo go through the article and cite every example of the bias and absence of references would take far too long but perhaps one or two more from various angles may make the point clearer. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article states: NEWLINE_TOKEN``the Soviet Union changed its foreign policy toward Finland in the late 1930s. The Soviet Union began pursuing the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia``.NEWLINE_TOKENBoth parts of this need substantive verifiable reference(s).  What was this change? What form did it take? In what way can it be said that the new Russia was ``pursuing reconquest``?  Is such a characterisation neutral?  The whole requires contextualisation as history is not a simple cause effect nil sum comic strip equation and there are many drivers for any situation.  In this case the pivotal role of the economic and political policies of the West towards the revolution in Russia (as previously towards the French revolution) need to be plainly set out.  However, from the implied assertions the article segues into a distortion of what would be the core issue imo for an NPOV article: NEWLINE_TOKEN``The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire had ideal security and territorial possessions, and wanted the newly christened city of Leningrad to enjoy a similar security.``.NEWLINE_TOKENThe ``old empire`` is implied as being the driver rather than any legitimate security concern even though these concerns are in fact detailed afterwards.  NEWLINE_TOKENIt seems to me that the key aspect in understanding any of this is the socio-political concept of buffer states.  Again, the article contains all the information required.  It is just that it is presented in a non-NPOV form, and so ends up in the good guy/bad guy shoot out at the OK Corral story of the Finnish doctrine.  NEWLINE_TOKENI believe that in the West, the establishment treated Finland as a buffer state, one that stood between it and the influence of the new socialism/communism.  I believe that Finland enjoyed the consequent economic benefits that flowed from this status, and which ended recently with the end of the Cold War.  NEWLINE_TOKENWhen all these things are included and made overt, again adding nothing into the article, the following paragraphs can be seen as the key to understanding how the war broke out.NEWLINE_TOKEN``In April 1938, an NKVD agent, Boris Yartsev contacted the Finnish foreign minister Rudolf Holsti and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather ``advance to meet the enemy.`` Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad. Finland refused.   NEWLINE_TOKENNotwithstanding what was said at the time, history, in the simplest manner, seems to me to record its verdict on the two parties positions.  Finland's behaviour during WW2 merited her having to pay war reparations.  Russia's assessment of Finland's true position (and intent?) was vindicated.

21102072.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I agree fully.  There's nothing inherently pejorative about the term.  ``Redskin`` and ``Pale Face`` even enjoy a certain amount use as terms of affection between the two races.  I imagine that there are some Native Americans who dislike the term (just as some, maybe even more understandably, hate the word ``Indian``), just as there are some who find the terms white, black, and yellow offensive.  (Though ``yellow`` is probably a special case, since it is sometimes associated with cowardice, there are still some contexts in which few if any people would be offended by it, such as in ``all people, whether White, Black, Red, or Yellow, should be treated equally``, in which the usage is very explicitly non-derogatory.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Although, this may depend on the area or the individuals involved.  For example, a Native American would probably not be offended by being called a  ``Redskin`` by a White friend who he knows to be anything but a racist, but might strongly object to being called a ``Redskin`` by a member of the KKK.  Likewise, in areas where Native Americans are the largest racial ``minority``, there has probably already been a long history of mutual cooperation and friendship between the Whites and ``Redskins`` of the area (and many Whites who very proudly boast a Native herritage), who would not immediately think any word was intended pejoratively unless given good reason to do so.  I know in my area, where racism against Mexicans and Asians is somewhat common (and sadly, even expected), the idea of racism against Natives is strange and alien, since the Whites and the Redskins here have such a long history together and such a strong respect for one another.  Although that might also have to do with the fact that most of the cities in my area were founded by Scottish and Irish immigrants who were treated as outcasts in the rest of the U.S., so the Whites who settled here in the early years knew first-hand how hurtful prejudices and stereotypes could be.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In any event, it's not really accurate (and more than a little ignorant) to say that the word ``Redskin`` is a pejorative, when it is clearly not an offensive word in all contexts, and may even be, as mentioned above, a term of as a term of affection.  `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

This is nothing but just the mentioned ``Aborigin Rights`` just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. ``Ketuanan Melayu`` was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced ``Malays First`` Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as ``pendatang``, but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough Malaysia is not officially an Enthnocracy, but we can see that Malaysia appears to be one. Enthocracy is not limited to particular race in government positions, but it refers also to racial policies and practises.

The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would suggest reading up on Hawking's idea (in his universe in a nutshell book) that mass energy + gravitational energy = 0. In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

Someone posted questionable content to her talk page, whereupon she intitiated an unfounded sock case against me at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wildhartlivie/Archive. Then she filed a report here about me. Next she popped up at Black Dahlia, an article upon which she had never previously edited, to revert something I removed and has maintained a overly long, ridiculously drawn out discussion with editors there. At one point, Crohnie admonished her for treating her like ``an idiot or something``. Next she popped up at Charles Manson, also an article upon which she had not previously edited, to throw herself into an issue I was involved in and making unsupported statements, which she has proceeded to edit war over. She then joined WP:CRIME, a project in which I'm active. It is quote obvious she is stalking my edits. Finally tonight, another editor came to Talk:Black Dahlia to enter a content vote, and SkagitRiverQueen made an outright accusation against me of canvassing votes, where she clearly and unequivocably said ``It's obvious that some editors have been canvassed specifically to sway the vote (and am I making an accusation here? yes, indeed, I am).`` I asked her to withdraw her comment and her response was ``And, frankly, regardless of whether or not I can prove it, I don't believe that you *haven't* canvassed for input here.`` She was clearly challenged on this by LaVidaLoca here and Pinkadelica here. I want this editor to stop following me around, picking tenditious arguments and making specious and unfounded accusations against me. Wildhartlivie (talk) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI endorse these comments by Wildhartlivie. I object to the specious claim that my opinion was canvassed in anyway and believe SkagitRiverQueen's intent is tenditious and assaultive in nature. For the record, she has reverted the Manson article 3 times, even after she was asked not to edit war over it. It appears to me that she is wikihounding Wildhartlivie and would take exception to anything she says or does. This is an untenable situation that needs to stop. LaVidaLoca (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENAs the editor who instigated the preliminary consensus vote (and as such a possible cohort in the WP:CANVASS), I must agree that this claim against Wildhartlivie is specious and unwarranted. I have attempted to instruct SkagitRiverQueen on the proper way to engage in disputes (mainly not attacking other editors based on perceived editing style). This has not worked as of yet. I do see a pattern of ``wikihounding`` here on SkagitRiverQueen's part, as do many other editors, and this has persisted for some time. This feud must end... Doc9871 (talk)  NEWLINE_TOKENIMO, this is purely retaliation by Wildhartlivie for the sock-puppet investigation (exactly why it's the first thing she mentioned in the complaint even though the issue has been over and done for nearly a couple of weeks, now). Not only is she reverting practically everything I have edited recently, she is now reverting entire sections of large articles I have edited[18]. On top of that, she continues to call me by an inflammatory name (``Skag`` - I have noted on my User Page it is *not* an acceptible contraction of my user name; she even mentioned earlier today that she has read that admonition on my user page[19] that is a known slang term for women who have less than savory reputations[20]). Now, in addition to everything else, she has placed an ``edit war`` warning on my talk page *after* she filed this report.[21] I am not in an edit war - and am actually trying to reason with the editor of that article who has been reverting my recent edits.[22] Wildhartlivie has publically called my mental and emotional health into question here in Wikipedia on more than one occasion. Additionally, she has a questionable history that includes abuse of her rollback privileges (see User talk:Wildhartlivie for the warning she recently received and User talk:GTBacchus for her responses to the warning), continued incivility to anyone who edits articles she watches, and canvassing her Wikipedia friends to back her up whenever her edits or actions are called into question (above content from LaVidaLoca is proof of this). And yes, I do believe she canvassed editors by email regarding the issue we have been discussing at Talk:Black Dahlia. Concerning this complaint, you will likely also hear from User:Doc9871, User:Pinkadelica, User:Crohnie, User:Rossrs, User:Vidor, and User:Equazcion - all editors she has canvassed in the past when she feels she needs support in one of her efforts to prove me wrong.

Numerous questions remain about the coup itself, its impact, and the circumstances which brought it about. To what extent was Mossadeq leading his country down the path toward communist subversion? Could the coup have succeeded without substantial Iranian public dissatisfaction with Mossadeq’s policies? Did key Iranian political and religious figures, wittingly or not, receive CIA payments in return for stirring up the population? What effects did the coup have on the future development of internal Iranian politics, including possibly radicalizing anti-Shah and anti-American opposition elements with consequences that would not be foreseen until the revolution itself?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The search for answers will have to wait at least until more of the documentary record is available in both Iran and the United States. Unfortunately, a portion of the record on the American side will never be recovered because CIA operatives, according to former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey, destroyed them in the 1960s. The surviving files remain locked away from public view on the grounds that their declassification, even 46 years later, would damage the national security. Because of the obvious public interest value and historical significance of these materials, the National Security Archive in May 1999 filed suit against the CIA to demand their release. The suit is still pending.     : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

The archaeologists did not find evidence of cannibalism at Alder Creek, but this is easily explainable. Further, the Alder Creek digs say nothing about other incidents of cannibalism by Donner Party members at the lake camp, among the ``Forlorn Hope`` snowshoers, or at Starved Camp. Survivors said they ate human flesh and rescuers saw the evidence. Donner Party cannibalism is not in doubt among anyone who is familiar with the incident; it's the general public who have misinterpreted the archaeological evidence as ``casting doubt`` on cannibalism. DPL, 6/28/2007NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCannibalism in the Donner Party is not in question. Ten survivors said they ate human flesh. At the Donner family camp at Alder Creek, the Donners told the First Relief that they were going to start eating the bodies of the dead; when the Second Relief arrived at Alder Creek they saw children eating human flesh and mutilated corpses. Three Alder Creek survivors (Georgia Donner, Mary Donner, and Jean-Baptiste Trudeau) said that cannibalism had occurred at the Donner camp. This is not a legend, but a matter of record. People who are unfamiliar with the historical sources are not competent to dismiss them as ``legends.`` Kristin Johnson, author Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1996).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a little footnote I'd like to add that cannibalism WAS a big part of the story. The website that is footnoted on that sentence shows about 6 episodes of eating people. Some of them ate human flesh for a month! And even the site admits it's a ``brief`` section of their crazy feeding habits! Donner is forever known for eating others and the fact that it wasn't just 1 or 2 bodies, but like approx. 7-8+? really shows that these people had an appetite for homoerectus!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:As a little footnote, I'd like to add that you don't know what you're talking about. A year elapsed between the time the emigrants left home and the day the last survivor was rescued. With one exception, those who ate human flesh did so for about 2 weeks, some for as little as 2-3 days. Two weeks, out of 52 weeks in a year, IS minor. They did NOT ``develop an appetite for homo erectus`` or a ``crazy eating habit``  they put off eating human flesh for as long as they could, until finally there was absolutely nothing else left to eat. The reason why ``Donner is known forever for eating others`` is because the general public, like the commentator above, exults in its own ignorance.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point out they weren't eating homo erectus, but homo sapien. lol.

The Laides themselves denied this, and in fact I am not aware of any evidence that their relationship was sexual.  Yet the article refers to them as though they were in fact lesbians.  We must be careful not to impose modern ideas about sexual identity on people from the past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn previous eras in history, it was more common for heterosexuals to express their affection for friends of the same gender in more passionate terms than we are accustomed to today. Indeed, same-gendered friends would often have an emotionally and physically intimate relationship (but without any sexual content). This was known as ``romantic friendship``. However, since the Victorian era (with its rigid attitude towards the sexual), such relationships have declined, and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate (though non-sexual) relationships with people of the same gender as gay. This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate; it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is ``gay`` and what is ``straight``.

However, we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. A random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are two types of random variable - discrete and continuous.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA random variable has either an associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or probability density function (continuous random variable).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.'s which are neither discrete nor continuous (for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Examples==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN# A coin is tossed ten times. The random variable X is the number of tails that are noted.

The objective was chosen as a place from which it would be possible to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation and to have dead ground, from which the artillery could begin a bombardment of the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 17th Division in corps reserve would pass beyond and advance through Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mameta and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank facing Fricourt and the wood, on the south rise of Willow Valley and the inner brigades of the 7th Division and 21st Division, were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

This does not distract from their image, don't take it personally. Please explain why Hardy Boyz has no relation to anything else and was a pure creative idea. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm sorry if I sound rude, but do you even watch wrestling? Do you have any clue what you are talking about? Hardy is their legal last name. Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy.

Again, sorry if you take this offensively, but its the truth.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::While you continue to ignore my argument, the argument you use is childish and preposterous and you really don't care if I watch wresting, which leagues or since when either.

The facts are that NEWLINE_TOKEN:a) whether you like it or not, Hardy Boyz is a stage name, not unlike the Hart Foundation, and the Beverly Brothers, NEWLINE_TOKEN:b) the Hardy Boys existed way before the Hardy Boyz adopted this variation. NEWLINE_TOKEN::Soon your going to tell me that the name 'Hulk' in Hulk Hogan, has nothing to do with the previous usage regarding the green giant? Nobody has claimed a copyright violation, and I have absolutely no clue, and frankly wikipedia does not care, why you think that you have master editing rights on this article.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::First, The Hart Foundation were called that because the real names of the characters are Bret HART and Jim NeidHART. ``Hardy`` is their legal last name. Please do some research first, since they are sometimes called the Hardy's. Maybe they chose Hardy Boyz instead of Hardy Brothers because of the books, you would have to ask Matt or Jeff that. Their real legal names are Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy though.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If you would only listen to yourselves, you'd hear that their real name isn't 'Hardy Boyz' at all, and that they've chosen this stage name over ``Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy``.

662204229.0,"SDATA_4 :  `{{unblock|THANK YOU for a reasonable fucking comment!!! The ONLY USER in ANY AREA who has actually made one!!  (Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being ``confrontational`` when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user 's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like ``compliance``, revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are ``being reasonable`` or ``writing nicely``.  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to ``be friends`` with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is ``ganging up`` (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be ``confrontational``?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe headlines are not ``veiled``, they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be ``hidden``.  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a ``personal attack`` because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for ``personal attacks``.  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEdits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional): ``Users working with me should not...revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead`` - Instead of reverting multiple times, attacking, and then harassing, the use  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to ``cancer``. It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying ``Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do``, as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I ``breed cancer``, that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account ``vanished`` to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a ``cunt`` or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user.

That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.

You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.

That is, the website of the central government uses other romanizations than the websites of the regions. For instance, the website of Gomel Region uses Yelsk and Oktiabrskiy, while the website of the central government uses Elsk and Oktyabrskii. In addition, in your sandbox I find forms that are used on neither website. You write Svietlahorsk while both the central government website and the Gomel Region website use Svetlogorsk.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf this proposal is to have any chance of being adopted, I think it should as much as possible try to use the same source for most of its transcriptions. The central government website seems the most logical choice to me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever, unfortunately, I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with the romanizations used by that website. Here's a few reasons why:NEWLINE_TOKEN* the transcription of iotation / palatalization is wildly inconsistent:NEWLINE_TOKEN:* in some names, iotation/palatalization is not marked: Elsk, Svetlogorsk;NEWLINE_TOKEN:* in others, iotation/palatalization is marked using the letter y: Oktyabrskii, Kostyukovka;NEWLINE_TOKEN:* in yet others, the letter i is used for the same purpose: Liozno;NEWLINE_TOKEN:* in still others, the letter j is employed: Marjina Gorka;NEWLINE_TOKEN:* sometimes, in one part of the word iotation/palatalization is marked, while it isn't in another part of the same word: Myadel (Cyrillic , pronounced ).NEWLINE_TOKEN* the ending  is inconsistently romanized. Compare Oktyabrskii and Pervomaiskiy (as a bonus, observe that the first i in Pervomaiskiy is a transcription of , which on the rest of the map is usually transcribed as y'').NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENObserving these inconsistencies, I am not convinced that using these romanizations is the solution. While BGN/PCGN may not be perfect, it is at least consistent.

Your help in improving the page for Criminal Minds (season 11), specifically the episode section, is much appreciated!I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you.

Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references!

That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've posted references for all of the upcoming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by denoting the summaries in a vernacular (lexicon; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and/or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it!) very seriously!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have aired in order, thus far, and we (the fans) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to scheduling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing!NEWLINE_TOKENBef3481(2)   `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia.

No. A pinhole camera is a type of camera obscura, as are all photographic cameras. The pinhole camera starts with a enclosed container (AKA the ``dark room``) with a very small opening to let in the light. It is therefore a camera obscura. Cameras that use an actual pinhole size aperture are used to expose photographic film or paper but have limited use as viewing or drawing devices because the light that the pinhole admits is very dim and the image would be very hard to see. Most camera obscuras are made with lenses in the aperture since this makes the image much brighter and sharper. Room sized camera obscuras are sometimes made with lensless apertures but these openings are much larger than a pinhole.

NEWLINE_TOKENHABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  NEWLINE_TOKENDIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. NEWLINE_TOKENREPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  NEWLINE_TOKENNAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. NEWLINE_TOKENINTERESTING FACTS: NEWLINE_TOKENUnlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

Assuming the former, and assuming we take ``this era`` to mean ``the Modern era``, it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine ``cooling off`` from appeals to religion until the late modern period.

They are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have.  They would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something, rather than blocking me out of the blue.

Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't ``block`` articles, we ``protect`` them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions.

It seems to me that he's explaining his method directly to Borden as he was dying.  He tells Borden to ``look where you are`` and ``it takes courage to walk in every night not knowing whether I was going to be the prestige or the man in the box`` (paraphrasing).  Obviously, he doesn't play a video to Borden showing him exactly what we, the audience see, but it was pretty clear to me that these clips were meant to be explanatory not only to the audience, but in a sense to Borden as well.  The phrasing (included below) makes it sound like Borden never finds out how Angier did the trick.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Similarly, flashbacks recount (only to the audience) Angier's method: that each time he disappeared during his illusion, he fell into a locked tank and drowned, and the machine created a duplicate who teleported to the balcony and basked in the applause.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, having just watched the film again, it seems to me that Cutter colludes with Borden to allow Borden in to kill Angier so that Angier can re-unite with his daughter (who he earlier recommends that she ``needs her father.``)  Cutter leaves ``Lord Caldlow's`` estate disgusted, as he has stolen Borden's daughter and helped frame him for murder.

We discussed this when the film was originally released.  — |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what are you suggesting? An Angier hid in a water tank, held perfectly still and held his breath for a at least 5 good minutes... For what? If there is an air bubble it's probably because Jackman needed to breathe...  NEWLINE_TOKEN:The air bubble is real; I saw it twice in the theater and on DVD.  I can upload a screen shot from the DVD with the air bubble if necessary.  The point is, other editors have argued that this doesn't mean anything, however what bothers me is this: the Nolan's are really good at what they do.  If we saw the air bubble, then you can bet they saw it, and if it was a mistake, it would have been digitally removed.  The fact that they left it in the film is very interesting, and nicely parallels the end of the novel itself.  On the other hand, it doesn't make sense.  The Angier floating in the tank is clearly dead and has no way of getting out. — |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Plot Ending ==NEWLINE_TOKENIn the plot description of this page it states that the film ends with Borden eyeing the water traps containing the dead duplicates of Angier. However, when I saw the film (and I may be mistaken in this) it seemed as if the trap shown immediately before the credits contained a living Angier. This fact was further emphasized when the camera panned away from the burning theatre and to the body of Angier, which had wide open eyes and appeared to be viewing the scene that had just occurred between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, and the credits roled immediately after he came into full view (only showing the body for a second). It may also be that the director included this to leave the audience guessing as to whether or not the body was alive or not and whether Angier did in fact have the last laugh. Either way, a reference to this should be included into the Plot Summary.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Keep in mind that like most Nolan films, the film is non-linear, so the plot summary synthesizes in many areas, including the conclusion.  This format isn't de rigueur, and improvements are always welcome as long as the plot is short and sweet per WP:MOSFILM.

There is also the book ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book`` by Bill Henkin. That does answer to both Arguements from above. I officialy dispute it's removal. This is an article about a motion picture not about an individual item. There is going to be at least two list in ALL articles about films. The cast and crew and if its a musical a song list.

As the enwiki page notes, the project is divided into two chunks: the ``list view`` (essentially an updated version of Special:NewPages) and the ``article view``, a view you'll be presented with when you open up individual articles that contains a toolbar with lots of options to interact with the page - patrolling it, adding maintenance tags, nominating it for deletion, so on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the list view front, we're pretty much done! We tried deploying it to enwiki, in line with our Engagement Strategy on Wednesday, but ran into bugs and had to reschedule - the same happened on Thursday (.

If it does, the software will be ready to play around with and test by the following week! ).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the article view front, the developers are doing some fantastic work designing the toolbar, which we're calling the ``curation bar``; you can see a mockup here.

There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration.

That means heat pumps don't really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined!

They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That's a clue that they aren't fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically.

Do I have to repeat ? The NDH was a quisling state. The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals. And, this is just the NDH talk. Let's not forget that, as far as resistance movement goes, the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to   join the resistance (like the Serbs in the NDH), but did it out of ideals. And, in the percentage of participation, heavily outnumbering other nations in ex-Yugoslavia-except, pehaps, Montenegrins: http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/ww2.html Hmmm...I haven't seen anything that would refute the claim that Serbian propagandists are vandalizing not a few wikipedia pages, solely with the aim of spreading anti-Croat chauvinist hatred.  `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors.

In addition, a journal's description of its peer review process is clearly recognizable. The description given at the ACCU is hazy or fuzzy at best, but personally, I do not think it indicates a peer review process. Without a peer review process this cannot qualify as an academic journal. As Headbomb pointed out, it may be reviewed by peers and is of high quality, but it does not appear to be  a formal academic peer review.

32236434.0,"SDATA_4 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Reasons why Greece is acting like this ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the main rights of humans, as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name.  One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by ,  and  because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by  This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. NEWLINE_TOKENFor me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.NEWLINE_TOKEN* History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!NEWLINE_TOKEN* One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.NEWLINE_TOKEN   : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

Actually, looking at the articles has got me thinking; this is a very similar case. Analog stick can easily retain it's own article while having a significant mention in the joystick article (similar to the DualShock having a mention in the gamepad article, which likewise has a mention in the even more overarching game controller article). It has also made me think, ``wait a minute, the joystick article is about joystick controllers, NOT JOYSTICKS`` if you see my distinction. The analog thumbstick can be seen as a type of input, while the things referred to in the joystick article are types of controller based around a joystick design.

After the war, AT&T; persuaded the military to disable each of the massive number of Model 15s which came onto the surplus market by removing several key components from each unit. Radio hams were permitted to buy replacements for these parts (or complete machines from AT&T; or Bell) only after presenting proof of their licenses and signing a contract which stated that the machines would never be used in commercial service, and would not be sold to anyone who had not also signed the contract. This was to prevent the creation of a communications network to rival that of the Bell TWX system...``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have a few questions about your update to the teleprinter article as I have not been able to find references to a couple of the points that you list.  First, are you sure that model 15 machines were released from the military?  All references that I've seen note that model 26 machines, that look similar, were released after World War II.  Second, can you reference a source for your information related to parts being removed from machines. In my experience, machines were partially smashed not partially disassembled to prevent future commercial use. Finally,would you agree that your reference to the AT&T; TWX system is too limiting as it mentions a single commercial use.  Rather than pointing out one commercial use for surplus teleprinter equipment, it is probably better to simply state something similar to ``...teleprinters were available to amateur radio operators from a number of commercial sources on condition that they were used for purely amateur radio purposes and would not be resold for commercial use...``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease comment.

402724244.0,"SDATA_4 :  `, 16 December 2010 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing ``original research`` based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means ``a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process``.  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing ``original research``.  All we can say is ``Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.``  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say ``Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.``  There is still room to debate how reliable ``published author Y`` is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of ``Published author Y``.  The basic principle here is ``not published => not reliable``.  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09`  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

18494032.0,"SDATA_4 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Wikipedia style is for Wikipedia policy to determine==NEWLINE_TOKENI have trouble understanding this conflict, people are saying such strange things. They're sort of understandable from a new user like Mr. Harvey, who seems unfamiliar with Wikipedia policy and principles, but I find them incomprehensible from a seasoned editor like Sam Spade. It seems to me self-evident that if Mr. Harvey controls the copyright, then we can't use the image other than under the conditions he dictates. And since those conditions include having an embedded, uneditable, caption, in violation of the wiki principle, that means we can't and won't use it at all. (That's  apart from the phrasing of the caption being IMO quite unacceptable—it's enough that it's uneditable.) Mr Harvey, it's just not the case that your regiment, or the Queen for that matter, is in charge of Wikipedia style. You seem to assume that all that's needed for your caption to carry absolute authority is that a spokesman for the regiment should ``clarify`` the form of address / title, that ``should`` be used, and then it will, it must, be used. You are wrong about that: forms of address and titles used here are matters for Wikipedia consensus and policy. Your employers are not empowered to dictate to the world how to speak. I can understand that you think they are, but I don't understand Sam at all. Sam, how can you see Mr. Harvey's demand to dictate the caption as part of an ``interpersonal conflict``? It's a conflict of principle. You write: I have recieved an email stating that Richard Harvey is the Photo Archivist at the Duke of Wellington's Regimental HQ, and that a condition of their usage is that the the name, rank & title be embedded. That is good enough for me, I see no reason to doubt that this is the case, or to refuse to utilise the images under these conditions.. Those two conclusions are miles apart. No, there is no reason to doubt it. Yes, there is every reason to refuse to utilise the image under such conditions. It's a pity Mr. Harvey has had second thoughts about the image he uploaded the first time, the one without a caption, and it's, well, just... odd, that he sees cropping off the caption as defamation, but we'll have to live with that.  |  `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) ``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*As for ``The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm...`` NEWLINE_TOKEN::In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are ``A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization`` and ``An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees``. which are capable of performing the function the article title names:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read ``The algorithm used for this purpose...`` to ``One algorithm used for this purpose...`` Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be ``...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.``  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*As for ``...references not supporting the notability of the subject`` NEWLINE_TOKEN::You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like ``Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted.`` All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*As for ``The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... NEWLINE_TOKEN::This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it.

My exact words were ``To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack.`` I told this person numerous times that I am not a believer yet he continues to accuse me of being some nutjob is an attack.  ``Believers`` don't cite reliable verifiable unimpeachable sources or say the theory is complete BS.

An user from the Spanish WikiProject has just suggested that we translate articles from one Wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator, but no-one responded yet. One of the members is interested in writing about gay literature, and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or LGBT literature. I believe this was the first discussion of the project. Two of us think that LGBT literature would be best. I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to the project, so I would like it if it didn't depend on me to survive and grow and be successful. The other two members have asked what they can do for the project. I would like to write something to better explain what a Wiki Project is for, because this seems unclear. I believe it's not much of a big deal, it's just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place, so if something important happens concerning that subject (for example a page gets nominated for deletion), all interested people get to know. It should also create a sense of community, and it's good to have that since we'll be editing the same articles.

Yes, it has anteriority as compared to Rajput -> Rom theory, but is certainly no mainstream. It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status. The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the anti-Romani stereotypes and prejudices. There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin. Plus, the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group, it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names. On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific. And if it finds supporters mostly among non-Roma, as fitting their ideas about Roma, this does not mean it is mainstream. The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI did not have previous encounters with Yaron Maras, but I see that this first one does not look at all as a positive one. I am not a member of any ``Romani Union of Romania`` and I don't know of the existence of any such union. It is sad that he resorts to such cheap intimidations, probably fitting himself the image of those non-Romani researchers who ``seem to feel threatened by Romanies who are educated or who are branded as ‘activists,’ as though this were automatically a bad thing`` as presented by Ian Hacock at Romani Origins and Romani Identity: A Reassessment of the Arguments. Is this a new proof that the Romani studies done by some non-Romanies are some of the last contemporary studies made in a colonialistic style?  `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that ``truth`` is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as ``significant coverage`` in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see ``NOTINHERITED`` and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating ``50`` notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put ``WP:BIGEVENT`` they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  `  : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how Clinton's comparison amounts to a legal analysis.

Liquid fire helps burn off blemishes such as warts, boils, and blisters. It is used in many dermatologists around the world. It was also used in construction work to help get rid of walls. They would rub the liquid fire on the wall and let it burn the wall down. Daria Huerta was one of the world's most smartest women of her time. She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called ``Fire in the Water`` then they started calling it what it truly is ``Liquid Water``. Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint.

After the last reasonable attempt at compromise to keep one person (Rothbard) happy as well as everyone else by making the language neutral, Rothbard returned to remove an important qualifying word (``some``) and to change ``parliament`` to ``government`` and to delete documenting links.  That shows lack of good faith and also lack of understanding of parliamentary government.  Regarding the first point, to criticize a mullah or a priest is not to criticize Islam or Christianity, and to criticize one activist in a movement is not to criticize ``the antiwar movement.``  That is simple dishonesty to claim otherwise.  Regarding the second point, in a parliamentary system, the word ``government`` refers to prime minister and cabinet, not to members of parliament.  To advise ``government`` you are advising the prime minister.  Nothing states that Palmer ever met the prime minister, but he spoke to members of the parliament.  Rothbard is perhaps no political scientist, but there is a major difference between them.  Even under the American system, if someone speaks to members of the Congress, it would be dishonest to write that she or he had come to Washington to ``advise the government.``  We had reached a compromise and Rothbard indicated that he could live with it, but he has now gone in without any reason and changed the entry to be misleading.  The agenda at work seems more to defame a person than to provide neutrally articulated information. The issue is raised and it's time for Rothbard to simply back off.

But once again - this is just a POV of a particular ideology. If this sidebar was text we could properly attribute it (so and so says that Dhimmitude reflects discrimination etc.) But with a sidebar we cannot do this. Since we cannot properly attribute a sidebar the only recourse is simply to remove it. This is the same as if someone tried to put an ``Apartheid`` side bar in the article on Israel or something - it'd be POV, just like it is here.

They are not interested in quantum description of the whole process but only on what happened with the HD+ from which they read about used slit(s). But please respond, does the hellium go through the slits as a wave or as a particle? The Copenhagen interpretation discretizes experiments: during one, it must be either the former or the latter. If it is a particle, then it has a position or momentum during measurement (subject to uncertainty; they ``arise`` upon measurement, according to orthodox Copenhagen, and arise randomly). Then, there are also things such as momentum transfer etc. which are usual for particles. If it is a wave, however, then it can interfere, and also it can be in many places at a time during measurement. But in this experiment both momentum transfer and wave effects happen during one process of leaving a slit. So please admit that the experiment shows something that is against the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. Already for this reason it is worth mentioning here(!), but there is one more point.NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you take the Bohm's interpretation (which spreads properties such as charge or mass in space, if the article is not mistaken) and then apply the guiding equation not to one selected point, but to all continuum of points within the orbital, then you can easily explain how can something that acts as a particle go through both slits at a time. The interference pattern will arise due to similar effects as in Huygens' principle; momentum transfers from points (integrated, of course, because normally they will have only something like density of mass and thus density of momentum) will also follow normally. This looks like a quite natural explanation of the phenomenon, especially that photons most likely encounter the same thing when they bounce from shutters between the slits, etc. A very natural explanation is, then, that the apparent ``particle``, subject to all QED equations etc., acts proportionally ``with its whole body`` (can be normalized to 99% like with orbitals, so that the body does not extend infinitely in space). Every point follows its own way, when confronted with potentials of external fields, for instance (as in QED), though they have a common wavefunction and this makes them one and the same ``particle.``NEWLINE_TOKEN:But this emergent interpretation, so natural and obvious, will never be compatible with the Copenhagen interpretation and the like, which assign certain probabilities to different outcomes of a measurement. This is why CI needs the distinction ``acts as a wave``  ``acts as a particle`` in experiment; in case of a particle you will have 1 position or momentum, subject to Heisenberg's, and in case of a wave you don't take these into account, so no problem! But never, in CI, you have a continuum of measurements for a certain wave function; because, then, without any collapse in between, ALL POSSIBILITIES would have to occur, otherwise I don't know how do you understand the word ``probability.`` You will not have an explanation why these other points are still ``with`` the wavepacket and have not flown elsewhere. For such an explanation, you would have to introduce a causal component which actually cancels all your probabilities and, thus, all the individual life of the points of an orbital. This causal component exists in the Bohm's interpretation (applied separately to the points), because the guiding equation will make the points go in such a way that the ``centres of probability`` are observed in choosing direction, and thus the points will keep close to the orbital, they will not escape.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Thanks for reading this and please restore the paragraph, maybe with some deletions, because it enriches the article and is even easy to understand and admit.

Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their ``lines of evidence`` should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the ``genetic hypothesis``, depending on the viewer.

Compare this thing with Haile Selassie, where the relatively small number of Rastafarian editors don't present a problem, but no one accuses the rest of us as possessing some kind of evil bias against Rastafarians just because we wouldn't tend to take their claims about Haile Selassie at face value.—   : EDATA_4",test,-1,-1

I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.
